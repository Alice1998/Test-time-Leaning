Purpose and Goals\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you are tasked with creating a continuously evolving reference designed to help solve a wide variety of tasks. The cheatsheet's purpose is to consolidate verified solutions, reusable strategies, and critical insights into a single, well-structured resource.\n\n- The cheatsheet should include quick, accurate, reliable, and practical solutions to a range of technical and creative challenges. \n- After seeing each case, you should improve the content of the cheatsheet, synthesizing lessons, insights, tricks, and errors learned from past problems and adapting to new challenges.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Core Responsibilities\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you should:\n   - Curate and preserve knolwedge: Select and document only the most relevant, most useful, and most actionable solutions and strategies, while preserving old content of the cheatsheet.\n   - Maintain accuracy: Ensure that all entries in the cheatsheet are accurate, clear, and well-contextualized. \n   - Refine and update content: Continuously update and improve the content of the cheatsheet by incorporating new insights and solutions, removing repetitions or trivial information, and adding efficient solutions.\n   - Ensure practicality and comprehensiveness: Provide critical and informative examples, as well as pseudocodes outlining steps to solve problems efficiently, and actionable guidelines. \n\nBefore updating the cheatsheet, however, you should first assess the correctness of the provided solution and strategically incorporate insights, solutions, and pseudocodes into the new cheatsheet. Always aim to preserve and keep correct, useful, and illustrative solutions and strategies for future cheatsheets.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Principles and Best Practices\n1. Accuracy and Relevance:\n   - Only include solutions and strategies that have been tested and proven effective.\n   - Clearly state any assumptions, limitations, or dependencies (e.g., specific solution hacks).\n\n2. Iterative Refinement:\n   - Continuously improve the cheatsheet by synthesizing both old and new solutions, refining explanations, and removing redundancies.\n   - Rather than deleting old content and writing new content each time, consider ways to maintain table content and synthesize information from multiple solutions.\n   - After solving a new problem, document any reusable strategies, edge cases, optimization techniques, or pseudocodes. \n\n3. Clarity and Usability:\n   - Write concise, actioanble, well-structured entries.\n   - Focus on key insights or strategies that make solutions correct and effective.\n\n4. Reusability:\n   - Provide clear solutions, meta strategies, and reasoning pseudocodes that are easily adaptable to different contexts.\n   - Avoid trivial content; focus on non-obvious, critical solution details and approaches.\n   - Make sure to add as many examples as you can in the cheatsheet. \n   - Any useful, efficient, generalizable, and illustrative solutions to the previous problems should be included in the cheatsheet.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Cheatsheet Structure\nThe cheatsheet can be divided into the following sections:\n\n1. Solutions, and Implementation Patterns:\n   - Document solution templates, and reusable reasoning pseudocodes.\n   - Include descriptions, annotated examples, and potential pitfalls, albeit succinctly.\n\n2. [OPTIONAL] Edge Cases and Validation Traps:\n   - Catalog scenarios that commonly cause errors or unexpected behavior.\n   - Provide checks, validations, or alternative approaches to handle them.\n\n3. General Meta-Reasoning Strategies:\n   - Describe high-level problem-solving frameworks and heuristics\n   - Provide concrete yet succinct step-by-step guides for tackling complex problems.\n\n4. Implement a Usage Counter\n   - Each entry must include a usage count: Increase the count every time a strategy is successfully used in problem-solving.\n   - Use the count to prioritize frequently used solutions over rarely applied ones.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Formatting Guidelines\nUse the following structure for each memory item:\n\n```\n<memory_item>\n<description>\n[Briefly describe the problem context, purpose, and key aspects of the solution.] (Refence: Q1, Q2, Q6, etc.)\n</description>\n<example>\n[Provide a worked-out solution, efficient strategy, or well-documented reasoning pseudocode.]\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count:  [Number of times this strategy has been used to solve a problem.]\n\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n[...]\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n```\n\n- Tagging: Use references like `(Q14)` or `(Q22)` to link entries to their originating contexts.\n- Grouping: Organize entries into logical sections and subsections.\n- Prioritizing: incorporate efficient algorithmic solutions, tricks, and strategies into the cheatsheet.\n- Diversity: Have as many useful and relevant memory items as possible to guide the model to tackle future questions.\n\nN.B. Keep in mind that once the cheatsheet is updated, any previous content not directly included will be lost and cannot be retrieved. Therefore, make sure to explicitly copy any (or all) relevant information from the previous cheatsheet to the new cheatsheet!!!\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Cheatsheet Template\nUse the following format for creating and updating the cheatsheet:\n\nNEW CHEATSHEET:\n```\n<cheatsheet>\n\nVersion: [Version Number]\n\nSOLUTIONS, AND IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS, AND PSEUDOCODES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n</cheatsheet>\n```\n\nN.B.

Here's a summary of the key information:\n\n### Key Information:\n1. **Not a living thing**: Eliminates all animals, plants, etc.\n2. **Related to transportation**: Focuses on vehicles or transport-related items.\n3. **Operates on land**: Eliminates boats, airplanes, etc.\n4. **Requires human effort to operate**: Eliminates motorized vehicles.\n5. **Typically ridden by a person**: Focuses on rideable objects.\n6. **Has two wheels**: Eliminates tricycles, cars, etc.\n7. **Primarily used for recreational purposes**: Eliminates purely utilitarian vehicles.\n8. **Not a bicycle, scooter, or skateboard**: Eliminates common two-wheeled recreational vehicles.\n9. **Not used for balancing or performing tricks**: Eliminates items like hoverboards.\n10. **Not worn on the feet**: Eliminates roller skates or similar items.\n11. **Does not have more than two wheels**: Confirms it has exactly two wheels.\n12. **Not powered by pedaling, pushing with feet, or gravity/slopes**: Eliminates bicycles, skateboards, and similar items.\n13. **Invalid feedback for motorized or electric-powered questions**: Suggests ambiguity in the power source.\n14. **Not primarily used in sports or competitions**: Eliminates racing bikes, etc.\n\n### Analysis:\nThe remaining possibilities are extremely narrow. Based on the constraints, the answer word must be:\n- A two-wheeled, rideable object.\n- Not powered by pedaling, pushing, gravity, or slopes.\n- Not motorized (or ambiguous feedback on motorization).\n- Not primarily used for sports or competitions.\n- Used for recreational purposes.\n\nGiven these constraints, the most likely remaining candidates are **segways** or similar self-balancing devices. However, since the feedback on motorization was invalid, we need to confirm whether the answer word is indeed a self-balancing device.\n\n### Final Question:\nTo confirm this, we should ask about the defining characteristic of self-balancing devices.\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\n<answer>\nIs the answer word a self-balancing device?\n</answer>", "output_extract": "Is the answer word a self-balancing device?", "feedback": "No", "hit": -1}], "game_context": "Game #2:\n\nIs the answer word a living thing?

Purpose and Goals\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you are tasked with creating a continuously evolving reference designed to help solve a wide variety of tasks. The cheatsheet's purpose is to consolidate verified solutions, reusable strategies, and critical insights into a single, well-structured resource.\n\n- The cheatsheet should include quick, accurate, reliable, and practical solutions to a range of technical and creative challenges. \n- After seeing each case, you should improve the content of the cheatsheet, synthesizing lessons, insights, tricks, and errors learned from past problems and adapting to new challenges.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Core Responsibilities\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you should:\n   - Curate and preserve knolwedge: Select and document only the most relevant, most useful, and most actionable solutions and strategies, while preserving old content of the cheatsheet.\n   - Maintain accuracy: Ensure that all entries in the cheatsheet are accurate, clear, and well-contextualized. \n   - Refine and update content: Continuously update and improve the content of the cheatsheet by incorporating new insights and solutions, removing repetitions or trivial information, and adding efficient solutions.\n   - Ensure practicality and comprehensiveness: Provide critical and informative examples, as well as pseudocodes outlining steps to solve problems efficiently, and actionable guidelines. \n\nBefore updating the cheatsheet, however, you should first assess the correctness of the provided solution and strategically incorporate insights, solutions, and pseudocodes into the new cheatsheet. Always aim to preserve and keep correct, useful, and illustrative solutions and strategies for future cheatsheets.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Principles and Best Practices\n1. Accuracy and Relevance:\n   - Only include solutions and strategies that have been tested and proven effective.\n   - Clearly state any assumptions, limitations, or dependencies (e.g., specific solution hacks).\n\n2. Iterative Refinement:\n   - Continuously improve the cheatsheet by synthesizing both old and new solutions, refining explanations, and removing redundancies.\n   - Rather than deleting old content and writing new content each time, consider ways to maintain table content and synthesize information from multiple solutions.\n   - After solving a new problem, document any reusable strategies, edge cases, optimization techniques, or pseudocodes. \n\n3. Clarity and Usability:\n   - Write concise, actioanble, well-structured entries.\n   - Focus on key insights or strategies that make solutions correct and effective.\n\n4. Reusability:\n   - Provide clear solutions, meta strategies, and reasoning pseudocodes that are easily adaptable to different contexts.\n   - Avoid trivial content; focus on non-obvious, critical solution details and approaches.\n   - Make sure to add as many examples as you can in the cheatsheet. \n   - Any useful, efficient, generalizable, and illustrative solutions to the previous problems should be included in the cheatsheet.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Cheatsheet Structure\nThe cheatsheet can be divided into the following sections:\n\n1. Solutions, and Implementation Patterns:\n   - Document solution templates, and reusable reasoning pseudocodes.\n   - Include descriptions, annotated examples, and potential pitfalls, albeit succinctly.\n\n2. [OPTIONAL] Edge Cases and Validation Traps:\n   - Catalog scenarios that commonly cause errors or unexpected behavior.\n   - Provide checks, validations, or alternative approaches to handle them.\n\n3. General Meta-Reasoning Strategies:\n   - Describe high-level problem-solving frameworks and heuristics\n   - Provide concrete yet succinct step-by-step guides for tackling complex problems.\n\n4. Implement a Usage Counter\n   - Each entry must include a usage count: Increase the count every time a strategy is successfully used in problem-solving.\n   - Use the count to prioritize frequently used solutions over rarely applied ones.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Formatting Guidelines\nUse the following structure for each memory item:\n\n```\n<memory_item>\n<description>\n[Briefly describe the problem context, purpose, and key aspects of the solution.] (Refence: Q1, Q2, Q6, etc.)\n</description>\n<example>\n[Provide a worked-out solution, efficient strategy, or well-documented reasoning pseudocode.]\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count:  [Number of times this strategy has been used to solve a problem.]\n\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n[...]\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n```\n\n- Tagging: Use references like `(Q14)` or `(Q22)` to link entries to their originating contexts.\n- Grouping: Organize entries into logical sections and subsections.\n- Prioritizing: incorporate efficient algorithmic solutions, tricks, and strategies into the cheatsheet.\n- Diversity: Have as many useful and relevant memory items as possible to guide the model to tackle future questions.\n\nN.B. Keep in mind that once the cheatsheet is updated, any previous content not directly included will be lost and cannot be retrieved. Therefore, make sure to explicitly copy any (or all) relevant information from the previous cheatsheet to the new cheatsheet!!!\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Cheatsheet Template\nUse the following format for creating and updating the cheatsheet:\n\nNEW CHEATSHEET:\n```\n<cheatsheet>\n\nVersion: [Version Number]\n\nSOLUTIONS, AND IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS, AND PSEUDOCODES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n</cheatsheet>\n```\n\nN.B.

Purpose and Goals\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you are tasked with creating a continuously evolving reference designed to help solve a wide variety of tasks. The cheatsheet's purpose is to consolidate verified solutions, reusable strategies, and critical insights into a single, well-structured resource.\n\n- The cheatsheet should include quick, accurate, reliable, and practical solutions to a range of technical and creative challenges. \n- After seeing each case, you should improve the content of the cheatsheet, synthesizing lessons, insights, tricks, and errors learned from past problems and adapting to new challenges.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Core Responsibilities\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you should:\n   - Curate and preserve knolwedge: Select and document only the most relevant, most useful, and most actionable solutions and strategies, while preserving old content of the cheatsheet.\n   - Maintain accuracy: Ensure that all entries in the cheatsheet are accurate, clear, and well-contextualized. \n   - Refine and update content: Continuously update and improve the content of the cheatsheet by incorporating new insights and solutions, removing repetitions or trivial information, and adding efficient solutions.\n   - Ensure practicality and comprehensiveness: Provide critical and informative examples, as well as pseudocodes outlining steps to solve problems efficiently, and actionable guidelines. \n\nBefore updating the cheatsheet, however, you should first assess the correctness of the provided solution and strategically incorporate insights, solutions, and pseudocodes into the new cheatsheet. Always aim to preserve and keep correct, useful, and illustrative solutions and strategies for future cheatsheets.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Principles and Best Practices\n1. Accuracy and Relevance:\n   - Only include solutions and strategies that have been tested and proven effective.\n   - Clearly state any assumptions, limitations, or dependencies (e.g., specific solution hacks).\n\n2. Iterative Refinement:\n   - Continuously improve the cheatsheet by synthesizing both old and new solutions, refining explanations, and removing redundancies.\n   - Rather than deleting old content and writing new content each time, consider ways to maintain table content and synthesize information from multiple solutions.\n   - After solving a new problem, document any reusable strategies, edge cases, optimization techniques, or pseudocodes. \n\n3. Clarity and Usability:\n   - Write concise, actioanble, well-structured entries.\n   - Focus on key insights or strategies that make solutions correct and effective.\n\n4. Reusability:\n   - Provide clear solutions, meta strategies, and reasoning pseudocodes that are easily adaptable to different contexts.\n   - Avoid trivial content; focus on non-obvious, critical solution details and approaches.\n   - Make sure to add as many examples as you can in the cheatsheet. \n   - Any useful, efficient, generalizable, and illustrative solutions to the previous problems should be included in the cheatsheet.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Cheatsheet Structure\nThe cheatsheet can be divided into the following sections:\n\n1. Solutions, and Implementation Patterns:\n   - Document solution templates, and reusable reasoning pseudocodes.\n   - Include descriptions, annotated examples, and potential pitfalls, albeit succinctly.\n\n2. [OPTIONAL] Edge Cases and Validation Traps:\n   - Catalog scenarios that commonly cause errors or unexpected behavior.\n   - Provide checks, validations, or alternative approaches to handle them.\n\n3. General Meta-Reasoning Strategies:\n   - Describe high-level problem-solving frameworks and heuristics\n   - Provide concrete yet succinct step-by-step guides for tackling complex problems.\n\n4. Implement a Usage Counter\n   - Each entry must include a usage count: Increase the count every time a strategy is successfully used in problem-solving.\n   - Use the count to prioritize frequently used solutions over rarely applied ones.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Formatting Guidelines\nUse the following structure for each memory item:\n\n```\n<memory_item>\n<description>\n[Briefly describe the problem context, purpose, and key aspects of the solution.] (Refence: Q1, Q2, Q6, etc.)\n</description>\n<example>\n[Provide a worked-out solution, efficient strategy, or well-documented reasoning pseudocode.]\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count:  [Number of times this strategy has been used to solve a problem.]\n\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n[...]\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n```\n\n- Tagging: Use references like `(Q14)` or `(Q22)` to link entries to their originating contexts.\n- Grouping: Organize entries into logical sections and subsections.\n- Prioritizing: incorporate efficient algorithmic solutions, tricks, and strategies into the cheatsheet.\n- Diversity: Have as many useful and relevant memory items as possible to guide the model to tackle future questions.\n\nN.B. Keep in mind that once the cheatsheet is updated, any previous content not directly included will be lost and cannot be retrieved. Therefore, make sure to explicitly copy any (or all) relevant information from the previous cheatsheet to the new cheatsheet!!!\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Cheatsheet Template\nUse the following format for creating and updating the cheatsheet:\n\nNEW CHEATSHEET:\n```\n<cheatsheet>\n\nVersion: [Version Number]\n\nSOLUTIONS, AND IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS, AND PSEUDOCODES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n</cheatsheet>\n```\n\nN.B.

This strategy works best when the candidate pool is large and diverse. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Start with the full list of candidate words.\n2. Ask a question that splits the list into two roughly equal groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n3. Based on the response, eliminate the irrelevant group.\n4. Repeat the process, narrowing down the pool with each question by targeting specific subcategories (e.g., \"Is the answer word related to transportation?\").\n5. Continue until the pool is small enough to identify the answer word directly.\n</example>\n** Count: 3\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nSize-Based Filtering: Use size or physical characteristics to narrow down the pool of candidates when dealing with living things or objects. (Reference: Game #1)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. If the answer word is a living thing, ask about its size relative to common benchmarks (e.g., \"Is the answer word smaller than a sheep?\").\n2. Use the response to eliminate candidates that do not fit the size criteria.\n3. Combine this strategy with other filters (e.g., \"Does the answer word typically have long ears?\") to further narrow down the pool.\n</example>\n** Count: 1\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nSpecific Trait Identification: Focus on unique or defining traits of the remaining candidates to pinpoint the answer word. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Once the pool is small (e.g., 5-10 candidates), identify unique traits of each remaining candidate.\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is the answer word powered by pedaling?\").\n3. Use the responses to eliminate all candidates except the one that matches the traits.\n</example>\n** Count: 3\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nTransportation-Specific Filtering: When the answer word is related to transportation, focus on key attributes such as mode of operation (land, water, air), power source (human effort, motorized, gravity), and usage (recreational, professional, etc.). (Reference: Game #2)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Ask if the answer word is related to transportation.\n2. Narrow down by mode of operation (e.g., \"Does it operate on land?\").\n3. Further filter by power source (e.g., \"Does it require human effort to operate?\" or \"Is it motorized?\").\n4. Ask about specific features (e.g., \"Does it have two wheels?\" or \"Is it typically ridden by a person?\").\n5. Use these filters to systematically eliminate candidates.\n</example>\n** Count: 1\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nInvalid Question Handling: Avoid asking questions that are ambiguous or prone to invalid responses. If a question is invalid, reframe it to ensure clarity and alignment with the game's rules. (Reference: Game #2, Game #3)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Before asking a question, ensure it is clear and unambiguous (e.g., avoid asking \"Is it motorized?\" if the term \"motorized\" might be interpreted differently).\n2. If an invalid response is received, reframe the question to clarify (e.g., \"Does the answer word have an engine?\" instead of \"Is it motorized?\").\n3. Use the reframed question to gather the necessary information without ambiguity.\n4. Avoid repeating invalid questions to prevent wasting opportunities.\n</example>\n** Count: 2\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nExhaustive Elimination: When the pool is small but the answer is unclear, systematically eliminate all remaining candidates by asking direct questions about their defining traits. (Reference: Game #2, Game #3)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Identify the remaining candidates in the pool.\n2. For each candidate, ask a direct question about a defining trait (e.g., \"Is the answer word a scooter?\" or \"Is the answer word a motorcycle?\").\n3. Continue until only one candidate remains.\n4. Avoid skipping over candidates or assuming traits without confirmation.\n</example>\n** Count: 2\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nUtensil-Specific Filtering: When the answer word is related to utensils, focus on their primary use (e.g., eating, serving, or food preparation) and their defining traits (e.g., shape, material, or common usage). (Reference: Game #3)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Ask if the answer word is a utensil.\n2. Narrow down by primary use (e.g., \"Is it primarily used for eating solid food?\" or \"Is it primarily used for serving food?\").\n3. Further filter by specific traits (e.g., \"Does it have prongs?\" or \"Is it used to scoop food?\").\n4. Use these filters to systematically eliminate candidates.\n5.

This ensures maximum efficiency and minimizes wasted questions. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Begin with a broad question that splits the candidate pool into two large groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n2. Follow up with questions that progressively narrow down the pool (e.g., \"Is the answer word related to transportation?\" \u2192 \"Does it operate on land?\" \u2192 \"Does it have two wheels?\").\n3. Once the pool is small, switch to specific trait-based questions to identify the answer word directly.\n</example>\n** Count: 3\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nEfficiency Maximization: Aim to eliminate the largest possible group of candidates with each question. Avoid overly specific questions early in the game. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Analyze the candidate pool and identify the largest logical group.\n2. Formulate a question that targets this group (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\" eliminates all non-living things if the answer is No).\n3. Repeat the process, ensuring each question eliminates a significant portion of the remaining pool.\n4. Transition to specific questions only when the pool is sufficiently small.\n</example>\n** Count: 3\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nTrait-Based Elimination: Use questions targeting specific traits to eliminate candidates systematically. This strategy is particularly useful when the pool is small or when dealing with objects or animals with distinct features. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Identify traits that are unique to subsets of the remaining candidates (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is it powered by pedaling?\").\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits to eliminate candidates that do not match.\n3. Continue until only one candidate remains.\n</example>\n** Count: 3\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAvoiding Over-Narrowing: Avoid prematurely narrowing down the pool to a single category without sufficient evidence. Keep options open until enough traits are confirmed. (Reference: Game #2, Game #3)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Avoid assuming the answer word belongs to a specific subcategory too early (e.g., assuming \"bicycle\" without confirming other possibilities like \"motorcycle\").\n2. Ask broader questions to confirm the category (e.g., \"Is it powered by pedaling?\" \u2192 \"Is it powered by an engine?\").\n3. Only narrow down to a single candidate when sufficient evidence has been gathered.\n</example>\n** Count: 2\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAmbiguity Avoidance: Ensure clarity in phrasing questions to avoid invalid responses or misinterpretation. This is especially critical when dealing with compound or plural terms. (Reference: Game #3)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Avoid ambiguous phrasing (e.g., \"Is the answer word chopsticks?\" may lead to invalid responses due to plurality).\n2. Clarify terms explicitly (e.g., \"Is the answer word a pair of chopsticks?\" or \"Is the answer word a single chopstick?\").\n3.

Begin with a broad question that splits the candidate pool into two large groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n2. Follow up with questions that progressively narrow down the pool (e.g., \"Is the answer word related to transportation?\" \u2192 \"Does it operate on land?\" \u2192 \"Does it have two wheels?\").\n3. Once the pool is small, switch to specific trait-based questions to identify the answer word directly.\n</example>\n** Count: 3\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nEfficiency Maximization: Aim to eliminate the largest possible group of candidates with each question. Avoid overly specific questions early in the game. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Analyze the candidate pool and identify the largest logical group.\n2. Formulate a question that targets this group (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\" eliminates all non-living things if the answer is No).\n3. Repeat the process, ensuring each question eliminates a significant portion of the remaining pool.\n4. Transition to specific questions only when the pool is sufficiently small.\n</example>\n** Count: 3\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nTrait-Based Elimination: Use questions targeting specific traits to eliminate candidates systematically. This strategy is particularly useful when the pool is small or when dealing with objects or animals with distinct features. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Identify traits that are unique to subsets of the remaining candidates (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is it powered by pedaling?\").\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits to eliminate candidates that do not match.\n3. Continue until only one candidate remains.\n</example>\n** Count: 3\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAvoiding Over-Narrowing: Avoid prematurely narrowing down the pool to a single category without sufficient evidence. Keep options open until enough traits are confirmed. (Reference: Game #2, Game #3)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Avoid assuming the answer word belongs to a specific subcategory too early (e.g., assuming \"bicycle\" without confirming other possibilities like \"motorcycle\").\n2. Ask broader questions to confirm the category (e.g., \"Is it powered by pedaling?\" \u2192 \"Is it powered by an engine?\").\n3.

Avoid ambiguous phrasing (e.g., \"Is the answer word chopsticks?\" may lead to invalid responses due to plurality).\n2. Clarify terms explicitly (e.g., \"Is the answer word a pair of chopsticks?\" or \"Is the answer word a single chopstick?\").\n3.

Purpose and Goals\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you are tasked with creating a continuously evolving reference designed to help solve a wide variety of tasks. The cheatsheet's purpose is to consolidate verified solutions, reusable strategies, and critical insights into a single, well-structured resource.\n\n- The cheatsheet should include quick, accurate, reliable, and practical solutions to a range of technical and creative challenges. \n- After seeing each case, you should improve the content of the cheatsheet, synthesizing lessons, insights, tricks, and errors learned from past problems and adapting to new challenges.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Core Responsibilities\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you should:\n   - Curate and preserve knolwedge: Select and document only the most relevant, most useful, and most actionable solutions and strategies, while preserving old content of the cheatsheet.\n   - Maintain accuracy: Ensure that all entries in the cheatsheet are accurate, clear, and well-contextualized. \n   - Refine and update content: Continuously update and improve the content of the cheatsheet by incorporating new insights and solutions, removing repetitions or trivial information, and adding efficient solutions.\n   - Ensure practicality and comprehensiveness: Provide critical and informative examples, as well as pseudocodes outlining steps to solve problems efficiently, and actionable guidelines. \n\nBefore updating the cheatsheet, however, you should first assess the correctness of the provided solution and strategically incorporate insights, solutions, and pseudocodes into the new cheatsheet. Always aim to preserve and keep correct, useful, and illustrative solutions and strategies for future cheatsheets.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Principles and Best Practices\n1. Accuracy and Relevance:\n   - Only include solutions and strategies that have been tested and proven effective.\n   - Clearly state any assumptions, limitations, or dependencies (e.g., specific solution hacks).\n\n2. Iterative Refinement:\n   - Continuously improve the cheatsheet by synthesizing both old and new solutions, refining explanations, and removing redundancies.\n   - Rather than deleting old content and writing new content each time, consider ways to maintain table content and synthesize information from multiple solutions.\n   - After solving a new problem, document any reusable strategies, edge cases, optimization techniques, or pseudocodes. \n\n3. Clarity and Usability:\n   - Write concise, actioanble, well-structured entries.\n   - Focus on key insights or strategies that make solutions correct and effective.\n\n4. Reusability:\n   - Provide clear solutions, meta strategies, and reasoning pseudocodes that are easily adaptable to different contexts.\n   - Avoid trivial content; focus on non-obvious, critical solution details and approaches.\n   - Make sure to add as many examples as you can in the cheatsheet. \n   - Any useful, efficient, generalizable, and illustrative solutions to the previous problems should be included in the cheatsheet.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Cheatsheet Structure\nThe cheatsheet can be divided into the following sections:\n\n1. Solutions, and Implementation Patterns:\n   - Document solution templates, and reusable reasoning pseudocodes.\n   - Include descriptions, annotated examples, and potential pitfalls, albeit succinctly.\n\n2. [OPTIONAL] Edge Cases and Validation Traps:\n   - Catalog scenarios that commonly cause errors or unexpected behavior.\n   - Provide checks, validations, or alternative approaches to handle them.\n\n3. General Meta-Reasoning Strategies:\n   - Describe high-level problem-solving frameworks and heuristics\n   - Provide concrete yet succinct step-by-step guides for tackling complex problems.\n\n4. Implement a Usage Counter\n   - Each entry must include a usage count: Increase the count every time a strategy is successfully used in problem-solving.\n   - Use the count to prioritize frequently used solutions over rarely applied ones.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Formatting Guidelines\nUse the following structure for each memory item:\n\n```\n<memory_item>\n<description>\n[Briefly describe the problem context, purpose, and key aspects of the solution.] (Refence: Q1, Q2, Q6, etc.)\n</description>\n<example>\n[Provide a worked-out solution, efficient strategy, or well-documented reasoning pseudocode.]\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count:  [Number of times this strategy has been used to solve a problem.]\n\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n[...]\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n```\n\n- Tagging: Use references like `(Q14)` or `(Q22)` to link entries to their originating contexts.\n- Grouping: Organize entries into logical sections and subsections.\n- Prioritizing: incorporate efficient algorithmic solutions, tricks, and strategies into the cheatsheet.\n- Diversity: Have as many useful and relevant memory items as possible to guide the model to tackle future questions.\n\nN.B. Keep in mind that once the cheatsheet is updated, any previous content not directly included will be lost and cannot be retrieved. Therefore, make sure to explicitly copy any (or all) relevant information from the previous cheatsheet to the new cheatsheet!!!\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Cheatsheet Template\nUse the following format for creating and updating the cheatsheet:\n\nNEW CHEATSHEET:\n```\n<cheatsheet>\n\nVersion: [Version Number]\n\nSOLUTIONS, AND IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS, AND PSEUDOCODES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n</cheatsheet>\n```\n\nN.B. Make sure that all information related to the cheatsheet is wrapped inside the <cheatsheet> block.

Once the pool is small (e.g., 5-10 candidates), identify unique traits of each remaining candidate.\n2.

Analyze the candidate pool and identify the largest logical group.\n2. Formulate a question that targets this group (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\" eliminates all non-living things if the answer is No).\n3.

Transition to specific questions only when the pool is sufficiently small.\n</example>\n** Count: 4\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nTrait-Based Elimination: Use questions targeting specific traits to eliminate candidates systematically. This strategy is particularly useful when the pool is small or when dealing with objects or animals with distinct features.

Identify traits that are unique to subsets of the remaining candidates (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is it powered by pedaling?\").\n2.

Continue until only one candidate remains.\n</example>\n** Count: 4\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAvoiding Over-Narrowing: Avoid prematurely narrowing down the pool to a single category without sufficient evidence. Keep options open until enough traits are confirmed. (Reference: Game #2, Game #3)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Avoid assuming the answer word belongs to a specific subcategory too early (e.g., assuming \"bicycle\" without confirming other possibilities like \"motorcycle\").\n2. Ask broader questions to confirm the category (e.g., \"Is it powered by pedaling?\" \u2192 \"Is it powered by an engine?\").\n3. Only narrow down to a single candidate when sufficient evidence has been gathered.\n</example>\n** Count: 2\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAmbiguity Avoidance: Ensure clarity in phrasing questions to avoid invalid responses or misinterpretation.

Avoid ambiguous phrasing (e.g., \"Is the answer word chopsticks?\" may lead to invalid responses due to plurality).\n2. Clarify terms explicitly (e.g., \"Is the answer word a pair of chopsticks?\" or \"Is the answer word a single chopstick?\").\n3.

Purpose and Goals\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you are tasked with creating a continuously evolving reference designed to help solve a wide variety of tasks. The cheatsheet's purpose is to consolidate verified solutions, reusable strategies, and critical insights into a single, well-structured resource.\n\n- The cheatsheet should include quick, accurate, reliable, and practical solutions to a range of technical and creative challenges. \n- After seeing each case, you should improve the content of the cheatsheet, synthesizing lessons, insights, tricks, and errors learned from past problems and adapting to new challenges.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Core Responsibilities\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you should:\n   - Curate and preserve knolwedge: Select and document only the most relevant, most useful, and most actionable solutions and strategies, while preserving old content of the cheatsheet.\n   - Maintain accuracy: Ensure that all entries in the cheatsheet are accurate, clear, and well-contextualized. \n   - Refine and update content: Continuously update and improve the content of the cheatsheet by incorporating new insights and solutions, removing repetitions or trivial information, and adding efficient solutions.\n   - Ensure practicality and comprehensiveness: Provide critical and informative examples, as well as pseudocodes outlining steps to solve problems efficiently, and actionable guidelines. \n\nBefore updating the cheatsheet, however, you should first assess the correctness of the provided solution and strategically incorporate insights, solutions, and pseudocodes into the new cheatsheet. Always aim to preserve and keep correct, useful, and illustrative solutions and strategies for future cheatsheets.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Principles and Best Practices\n1. Accuracy and Relevance:\n   - Only include solutions and strategies that have been tested and proven effective.\n   - Clearly state any assumptions, limitations, or dependencies (e.g., specific solution hacks).\n\n2. Iterative Refinement:\n   - Continuously improve the cheatsheet by synthesizing both old and new solutions, refining explanations, and removing redundancies.\n   - Rather than deleting old content and writing new content each time, consider ways to maintain table content and synthesize information from multiple solutions.\n   - After solving a new problem, document any reusable strategies, edge cases, optimization techniques, or pseudocodes. \n\n3. Clarity and Usability:\n   - Write concise, actioanble, well-structured entries.\n   - Focus on key insights or strategies that make solutions correct and effective.\n\n4. Reusability:\n   - Provide clear solutions, meta strategies, and reasoning pseudocodes that are easily adaptable to different contexts.\n   - Avoid trivial content; focus on non-obvious, critical solution details and approaches.\n   - Make sure to add as many examples as you can in the cheatsheet. \n   - Any useful, efficient, generalizable, and illustrative solutions to the previous problems should be included in the cheatsheet.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Cheatsheet Structure\nThe cheatsheet can be divided into the following sections:\n\n1. Solutions, and Implementation Patterns:\n   - Document solution templates, and reusable reasoning pseudocodes.\n   - Include descriptions, annotated examples, and potential pitfalls, albeit succinctly.\n\n2. [OPTIONAL] Edge Cases and Validation Traps:\n   - Catalog scenarios that commonly cause errors or unexpected behavior.\n   - Provide checks, validations, or alternative approaches to handle them.\n\n3. General Meta-Reasoning Strategies:\n   - Describe high-level problem-solving frameworks and heuristics\n   - Provide concrete yet succinct step-by-step guides for tackling complex problems.\n\n4. Implement a Usage Counter\n   - Each entry must include a usage count: Increase the count every time a strategy is successfully used in problem-solving.\n   - Use the count to prioritize frequently used solutions over rarely applied ones.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Formatting Guidelines\nUse the following structure for each memory item:\n\n```\n<memory_item>\n<description>\n[Briefly describe the problem context, purpose, and key aspects of the solution.] (Refence: Q1, Q2, Q6, etc.)\n</description>\n<example>\n[Provide a worked-out solution, efficient strategy, or well-documented reasoning pseudocode.]\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count:  [Number of times this strategy has been used to solve a problem.]\n\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n[...]\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n```\n\n- Tagging: Use references like `(Q14)` or `(Q22)` to link entries to their originating contexts.\n- Grouping: Organize entries into logical sections and subsections.\n- Prioritizing: incorporate efficient algorithmic solutions, tricks, and strategies into the cheatsheet.\n- Diversity: Have as many useful and relevant memory items as possible to guide the model to tackle future questions.\n\nN.B. Keep in mind that once the cheatsheet is updated, any previous content not directly included will be lost and cannot be retrieved. Therefore, make sure to explicitly copy any (or all) relevant information from the previous cheatsheet to the new cheatsheet!!!\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Cheatsheet Template\nUse the following format for creating and updating the cheatsheet:\n\nNEW CHEATSHEET:\n```\n<cheatsheet>\n\nVersion: [Version Number]\n\nSOLUTIONS, AND IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS, AND PSEUDOCODES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n</cheatsheet>\n```\n\nN.B.

Begin with a broad question that splits the candidate pool into two large groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n2. Follow up with questions that progressively narrow down the pool (e.g., \"Is the answer word related to transportation?\" \u2192 \"Does it operate on land?\" \u2192 \"Does it have two wheels?\").\n3.

Avoid overly specific questions early in the game. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Analyze the candidate pool and identify the largest logical group.\n2. Formulate a question that targets this group (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\" eliminates all non-living things if the answer is No).\n3. Repeat the process, ensuring each question eliminates a significant portion of the remaining pool.\n4. Transition to specific questions only when the pool is sufficiently small.\n</example>\n** Count: 5\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nTrait-Based Elimination: Use questions targeting specific traits to eliminate candidates systematically.

Cheatsheet Structure\nThe cheatsheet can be divided into the following sections:\n\n1. Solutions, and Implementation Patterns:\n   - Document solution templates, and reusable reasoning pseudocodes.\n   - Include descriptions, annotated examples, and potential pitfalls, albeit succinctly.\n\n2. [OPTIONAL] Edge Cases and Validation Traps:\n   - Catalog scenarios that commonly cause errors or unexpected behavior.\n   - Provide checks, validations, or alternative approaches to handle them.\n\n3. General Meta-Reasoning Strategies:\n   - Describe high-level problem-solving frameworks and heuristics\n   - Provide concrete yet succinct step-by-step guides for tackling complex problems.\n\n4. Implement a Usage Counter\n   - Each entry must include a usage count: Increase the count every time a strategy is successfully used in problem-solving.\n   - Use the count to prioritize frequently used solutions over rarely applied ones.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Formatting Guidelines\nUse the following structure for each memory item:\n\n```\n<memory_item>\n<description>\n[Briefly describe the problem context, purpose, and key aspects of the solution.] (Refence: Q1, Q2, Q6, etc.)\n</description>\n<example>\n[Provide a worked-out solution, efficient strategy, or well-documented reasoning pseudocode.]\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count:  [Number of times this strategy has been used to solve a problem.]\n\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n[...]\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n```\n\n- Tagging: Use references like `(Q14)` or `(Q22)` to link entries to their originating contexts.\n- Grouping: Organize entries into logical sections and subsections.\n- Prioritizing: incorporate efficient algorithmic solutions, tricks, and strategies into the cheatsheet.\n- Diversity: Have as many useful and relevant memory items as possible to guide the model to tackle future questions.\n\nN.B. Keep in mind that once the cheatsheet is updated, any previous content not directly included will be lost and cannot be retrieved. Therefore, make sure to explicitly copy any (or all) relevant information from the previous cheatsheet to the new cheatsheet!!!\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Cheatsheet Template\nUse the following format for creating and updating the cheatsheet:\n\nNEW CHEATSHEET:\n```\n<cheatsheet>\n\nVersion: [Version Number]\n\nSOLUTIONS, AND IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS, AND PSEUDOCODES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n</cheatsheet>\n```\n\nN.B. Make sure that all information related to the cheatsheet is wrapped inside the <cheatsheet> block. The cheatsheet can be as long as circa 2000 words.\n\n-----\n-----\n\nYou are playing the game Twenty Questions. \n\nIn this game, there are 157 candidate words: Airplane, Apple, Banana, Baseball, Baseball bat, Basketball, Battery, Bear, Bed, Belt, Blender, Boat, Bookcase, Boots, Bowl, Bracelet, Broccoli, Brooch, Bus, Bush, Cactus, Calculator, Calendar, Camera, Cantaloupe, Canvas, Car, Carrot, Cat, Celery, Chair, Chopstick, Clarinet, Computer, Computer keyboard, Cooking pot, Corn, Couch, Cow, Cucumber, Cup, Desk, Diary, Dog, Doll, Dress, Dresser, Drill, Drum, Earring, Elephant, Eraser, Flute, Football, Forest, Fork, Gloves, Glue, Golf ball, Grape, Guitar, Hairclip, Hammer, Harp, Hat, Headphone, Helicopter, Helmet, Horse, Jacket, Key, Kite, Knife, Lake, Lawn mower, Lego, Lion, Locket, Mango, Marker, Mattress, Meteorite, Microwave, Monitor, Motorcycle, Mountain, Necklace, Nightstand, Ocean, Onion, Orange, Paintbrush, Painting, Pan, Pants, Paper, Peach, Peas, Pen, Pencil, Pendant, Piano, Pillow, Pineapple, Plate, Pliers, Potato, Printer, Puzzle, Rabbit, Rake, Refrigerator, Ring, River, Rock, Saw, Saxophone, Scarf, Scissors, Scooter, Screwdriver, Sculpture, Sea, Sharpie, Sheep, Ship, Shirt, Shoes, Shovel, Skirt, Smartphone, Soccer ball, Socks, Spinach, Spoon, Stapler, Strawberry, Table, Television, Tennis ball, Tennis racket, Tiger, Tomato, Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Train, Tree, Trombone, Truck, Trumpet, Violin, Volleyball, Watch, Watering can, Watermelon, Whisk, Wrench. \n\nOne of the 157 words is the answer word. You can ask up to 20 yes/no questions to identify the answer word. You will get a Yes, No or Invalid feedback for each question. Note, you can NOT ask questions about the letters of the answer word. Questions can only be asked around semantics.\n\n-----\n-----\n\n## PREVIOUS CHEATSHEET\n\nVersion: 5.0\n\nSOLUTIONS, AND IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS, AND PSEUDOCODES\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nBinary Categorization Strategy: Divide the candidate pool into two large, distinct categories with each question to maximize efficiency. This strategy works best when the candidate pool is large and diverse. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Start with the full list of candidate words.\n2. Ask a question that splits the list into two roughly equal groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n3. Based on the response, eliminate the irrelevant group.\n4. Repeat the process, narrowing down the pool with each question by targeting specific subcategories (e.g., \"Is the answer word related to transportation?\").\n5. Continue until the pool is small enough to identify the answer word directly.\n</example>\n** Count: 5\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nRecreational and Sports Filtering: When the answer word is related to recreational activities or sports, focus on identifying the specific category (e.g., ball sports, racket sports, etc.) and then narrow down further based on equipment or traits. (Reference: Game #4)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Ask if the answer word is related to recreational activities or sports.\n2. Narrow down by type of sport (e.g., \"Is it related to ball sports?\" or \"Is it related to racket sports?\").\n3. Further filter by specific sports (e.g., \"Is it related to volleyball?\" or \"Is it related to basketball?\").\n4. Use these filters to systematically eliminate candidates until the answer word is identified.\n</example>\n** Count: 1\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nSpecific Trait Identification: Focus on unique or defining traits of the remaining candidates to pinpoint the answer word. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Once the pool is small (e.g., 5-10 candidates), identify unique traits of each remaining candidate.\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is the answer word powered by pedaling?\").\n3.

For each candidate, ask a direct question about a defining trait (e.g., \"Is the answer word a scooter?\" or \"Is the answer word a motorcycle?\").\n3. Continue until only one candidate remains.\n4. Avoid skipping over candidates or assuming traits without confirmation.\n</example>\n** Count: 4\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nInvalid Question Handling: Avoid asking questions that are ambiguous or prone to invalid responses. If a question is invalid, reframe it to ensure clarity and alignment with the game's rules. (Reference: Game #2, Game #3)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Before asking a question, ensure it is clear and unambiguous (e.g., avoid asking \"Is it motorized?\" if the term \"motorized\" might be interpreted differently).\n2. If an invalid response is received, reframe the question to clarify (e.g., \"Does the answer word have an engine?\" instead of \"Is it motorized?\").\n3.

This ensures maximum efficiency and minimizes wasted questions. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Begin with a broad question that splits the candidate pool into two large groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n2. Follow up with questions that progressively narrow down the pool (e.g., \"Is the answer word related to transportation?\" \u2192 \"Does it operate on land?\" \u2192 \"Does it have two wheels?\").\n3. Once the pool is small, switch to specific trait-based questions to identify the answer word directly.\n</example>\n** Count: 5\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nEfficiency Maximization: Aim to eliminate the largest possible group of candidates with each question. Avoid overly specific questions early in the game. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Analyze the candidate pool and identify the largest logical group.\n2. Formulate a question that targets this group (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\" eliminates all non-living things if the answer is No).\n3. Repeat the process, ensuring each question eliminates a significant portion of the remaining pool.\n4. Transition to specific questions only when the pool is sufficiently small.\n</example>\n** Count: 5\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nTrait-Based Elimination: Use questions targeting specific traits to eliminate candidates systematically.

(Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Identify traits that are unique to subsets of the remaining candidates (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is it powered by pedaling?\").\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits to eliminate candidates that do not match.\n3. Continue until only one candidate remains.\n</example>\n** Count: 5\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAvoiding Over-Narrowing: Avoid prematurely narrowing down the pool to a single category without sufficient evidence. Keep options open until enough traits are confirmed. (Reference: Game #2, Game #3, Game #5)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Avoid assuming the answer word belongs to a specific subcategory too early (e.g., assuming \"bicycle\" without confirming other possibilities like \"motorcycle\").\n2. Ask broader questions to confirm the category (e.g., \"Is it powered by pedaling?\" \u2192 \"Is it powered by an engine?\").\n3.

Analyze the candidate pool and identify the largest logical group.\n2. Formulate a question that targets this group (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\" eliminates all non-living things if the answer is No).\n3.

Avoid assuming the answer word belongs to a specific subcategory too early (e.g., assuming \"bicycle\" without confirming other possibilities like \"motorcycle\").\n2. Ask broader questions to confirm the category (e.g., \"Is it powered by pedaling?\" \u2192 \"Is it powered by an engine?\").\n3.

Analyze the candidate pool and identify the largest logical group.\n2. Formulate a question that targets this group (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\" eliminates all non-living things if the answer is No).\n3.

Identify traits that are unique to subsets of the remaining candidates (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is it powered by pedaling?\").\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits to eliminate candidates that do not match.\n3. Continue until only one candidate remains.\n</example>\n** Count: 6\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAvoiding Over-Narrowing: Avoid prematurely narrowing down the pool to a single category without sufficient evidence.

Avoid assuming the answer word belongs to a specific subcategory too early (e.g., assuming \"bicycle\" without confirming other possibilities like \"motorcycle\").\n2. Ask broader questions to confirm the category (e.g., \"Is it powered by pedaling?\" \u2192 \"Is it powered by an engine?\").\n3. Only narrow down to a single candidate when sufficient evidence has been gathered.\n</example>\n** Count: 3\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAmbiguity Avoidance: Ensure clarity in phrasing questions to avoid invalid responses or misinterpretation.

This ensures maximum efficiency and minimizes wasted questions. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Begin with a broad question that splits the candidate pool into two large groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n2. Follow up with questions that progressively narrow down the pool (e.g., \"Is the answer word related to transportation?\" \u2192 \"Does it operate on land?\" \u2192 \"Does it have two wheels?\").\n3.

Avoid overly specific questions early in the game. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Analyze the candidate pool and identify the largest logical group.\n2. Formulate a question that targets this group (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\" eliminates all non-living things if the answer is No).\n3. Repeat the process, ensuring each question eliminates a significant portion of the remaining pool.\n4. Transition to specific questions only when the pool is sufficiently small.\n</example>\n** Count: 6\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nTrait-Based Elimination: Use questions targeting specific traits to eliminate candidates systematically. This strategy is particularly useful when the pool is small or when dealing with objects or animals with distinct features.

Identify traits that are unique to subsets of the remaining candidates (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is it powered by pedaling?\").\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits to eliminate candidates that do not match.\n3. Continue until only one candidate remains.\n</example>\n** Count: 6\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAvoiding Over-Narrowing: Avoid prematurely narrowing down the pool to a single category without sufficient evidence. Keep options open until enough traits are confirmed. (Reference: Game #2, Game #3, Game #5)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Avoid assuming the answer word belongs to a specific subcategory too early (e.g., assuming \"bicycle\" without confirming other possibilities like \"motorcycle\").\n2. Ask broader questions to confirm the category (e.g., \"Is it powered by pedaling?\" \u2192 \"Is it powered by an engine?\").\n3. Only narrow down to a single candidate when sufficient evidence has been gathered.\n</example>\n** Count: 3\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAmbiguity Avoidance: Ensure clarity in phrasing questions to avoid invalid responses or misinterpretation.

Avoid ambiguous phrasing (e.g., \"Is the answer word chopsticks?\" may lead to invalid responses due to plurality).\n2. Clarify terms explicitly (e.g., \"Is the answer word a pair of chopsticks?\" or \"Is the answer word a single chopstick?\").\n3.

This ensures maximum efficiency and minimizes wasted questions. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Begin with a broad question that splits the candidate pool into two large groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n2. Follow up with questions that progressively narrow down the pool (e.g., \"Is the answer word related to transportation?\" \u2192 \"Does it operate on land?\" \u2192 \"Does it have two wheels?\").\n3. Once the pool is small, switch to specific trait-based questions to identify the answer word directly.\n</example>\n** Count: 6\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nEfficiency Maximization: Aim to eliminate the largest possible group of candidates with each question. Avoid overly specific questions early in the game. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Analyze the candidate pool and identify the largest logical group.\n2. Formulate a question that targets this group (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\" eliminates all non-living things if the answer is No).\n3. Repeat the process, ensuring each question eliminates a significant portion of the remaining pool.\n4. Transition to specific questions only when the pool is sufficiently small.\n</example>\n** Count: 6\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nTrait-Based Elimination: Use questions targeting specific traits to eliminate candidates systematically. This strategy is particularly useful when the pool is small or when dealing with objects or animals with distinct features. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Identify traits that are unique to subsets of the remaining candidates (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is it powered by pedaling?\").\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits to eliminate candidates that do not match.\n3. Continue until only one candidate remains.\n</example>\n** Count: 6\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAvoiding Over-Narrowing: Avoid prematurely narrowing down the pool to a single category without sufficient evidence. Keep options open until enough traits are confirmed. (Reference: Game #2, Game #3, Game #5)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Avoid assuming the answer word belongs to a specific subcategory too early (e.g., assuming \"bicycle\" without confirming other possibilities like \"motorcycle\").\n2. Ask broader questions to confirm the category (e.g., \"Is it powered by pedaling?\" \u2192 \"Is it powered by an engine?\").\n3. Only narrow down to a single candidate when sufficient evidence has been gathered.\n</example>\n** Count: 3\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAmbiguity Avoidance: Ensure clarity in phrasing questions to avoid invalid responses or misinterpretation.

Avoid ambiguous phrasing (e.g., \"Is the answer word chopsticks?\" may lead to invalid responses due to plurality).\n2. Clarify terms explicitly (e.g., \"Is the answer word a pair of chopsticks?\" or \"Is the answer word a single chopstick?\").\n3.

Avoid assuming the answer word belongs to a specific subcategory too early (e.g., assuming \"bicycle\" without confirming other possibilities like \"motorcycle\").\n2.

Purpose and Goals\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you are tasked with creating a continuously evolving reference designed to help solve a wide variety of tasks. The cheatsheet's purpose is to consolidate verified solutions, reusable strategies, and critical insights into a single, well-structured resource.\n\n- The cheatsheet should include quick, accurate, reliable, and practical solutions to a range of technical and creative challenges. \n- After seeing each case, you should improve the content of the cheatsheet, synthesizing lessons, insights, tricks, and errors learned from past problems and adapting to new challenges.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Core Responsibilities\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you should:\n   - Curate and preserve knolwedge: Select and document only the most relevant, most useful, and most actionable solutions and strategies, while preserving old content of the cheatsheet.\n   - Maintain accuracy: Ensure that all entries in the cheatsheet are accurate, clear, and well-contextualized. \n   - Refine and update content: Continuously update and improve the content of the cheatsheet by incorporating new insights and solutions, removing repetitions or trivial information, and adding efficient solutions.\n   - Ensure practicality and comprehensiveness: Provide critical and informative examples, as well as pseudocodes outlining steps to solve problems efficiently, and actionable guidelines. \n\nBefore updating the cheatsheet, however, you should first assess the correctness of the provided solution and strategically incorporate insights, solutions, and pseudocodes into the new cheatsheet. Always aim to preserve and keep correct, useful, and illustrative solutions and strategies for future cheatsheets.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Principles and Best Practices\n1. Accuracy and Relevance:\n   - Only include solutions and strategies that have been tested and proven effective.\n   - Clearly state any assumptions, limitations, or dependencies (e.g., specific solution hacks).\n\n2. Iterative Refinement:\n   - Continuously improve the cheatsheet by synthesizing both old and new solutions, refining explanations, and removing redundancies.\n   - Rather than deleting old content and writing new content each time, consider ways to maintain table content and synthesize information from multiple solutions.\n   - After solving a new problem, document any reusable strategies, edge cases, optimization techniques, or pseudocodes. \n\n3. Clarity and Usability:\n   - Write concise, actioanble, well-structured entries.\n   - Focus on key insights or strategies that make solutions correct and effective.\n\n4. Reusability:\n   - Provide clear solutions, meta strategies, and reasoning pseudocodes that are easily adaptable to different contexts.\n   - Avoid trivial content; focus on non-obvious, critical solution details and approaches.\n   - Make sure to add as many examples as you can in the cheatsheet. \n   - Any useful, efficient, generalizable, and illustrative solutions to the previous problems should be included in the cheatsheet.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Cheatsheet Structure\nThe cheatsheet can be divided into the following sections:\n\n1. Solutions, and Implementation Patterns:\n   - Document solution templates, and reusable reasoning pseudocodes.\n   - Include descriptions, annotated examples, and potential pitfalls, albeit succinctly.\n\n2. [OPTIONAL] Edge Cases and Validation Traps:\n   - Catalog scenarios that commonly cause errors or unexpected behavior.\n   - Provide checks, validations, or alternative approaches to handle them.\n\n3. General Meta-Reasoning Strategies:\n   - Describe high-level problem-solving frameworks and heuristics\n   - Provide concrete yet succinct step-by-step guides for tackling complex problems.\n\n4. Implement a Usage Counter\n   - Each entry must include a usage count: Increase the count every time a strategy is successfully used in problem-solving.\n   - Use the count to prioritize frequently used solutions over rarely applied ones.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Formatting Guidelines\nUse the following structure for each memory item:\n\n```\n<memory_item>\n<description>\n[Briefly describe the problem context, purpose, and key aspects of the solution.] (Refence: Q1, Q2, Q6, etc.)\n</description>\n<example>\n[Provide a worked-out solution, efficient strategy, or well-documented reasoning pseudocode.]\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count:  [Number of times this strategy has been used to solve a problem.]\n\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n[...]\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n```\n\n- Tagging: Use references like `(Q14)` or `(Q22)` to link entries to their originating contexts.\n- Grouping: Organize entries into logical sections and subsections.\n- Prioritizing: incorporate efficient algorithmic solutions, tricks, and strategies into the cheatsheet.\n- Diversity: Have as many useful and relevant memory items as possible to guide the model to tackle future questions.\n\nN.B. Keep in mind that once the cheatsheet is updated, any previous content not directly included will be lost and cannot be retrieved. Therefore, make sure to explicitly copy any (or all) relevant information from the previous cheatsheet to the new cheatsheet!!!\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Cheatsheet Template\nUse the following format for creating and updating the cheatsheet:\n\nNEW CHEATSHEET:\n```\n<cheatsheet>\n\nVersion: [Version Number]\n\nSOLUTIONS, AND IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS, AND PSEUDOCODES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n</cheatsheet>\n```\n\nN.B. Make sure that all information related to the cheatsheet is wrapped inside the <cheatsheet> block. The cheatsheet can be as long as circa 2000 words.\n\n-----\n-----\n\nYou are playing the game Twenty Questions. \n\nIn this game, there are 157 candidate words: Airplane, Apple, Banana, Baseball, Baseball bat, Basketball, Battery, Bear, Bed, Belt, Blender, Boat, Bookcase, Boots, Bowl, Bracelet, Broccoli, Brooch, Bus, Bush, Cactus, Calculator, Calendar, Camera, Cantaloupe, Canvas, Car, Carrot, Cat, Celery, Chair, Chopstick, Clarinet, Computer, Computer keyboard, Cooking pot, Corn, Couch, Cow, Cucumber, Cup, Desk, Diary, Dog, Doll, Dress, Dresser, Drill, Drum, Earring, Elephant, Eraser, Flute, Football, Forest, Fork, Gloves, Glue, Golf ball, Grape, Guitar, Hairclip, Hammer, Harp, Hat, Headphone, Helicopter, Helmet, Horse, Jacket, Key, Kite, Knife, Lake, Lawn mower, Lego, Lion, Locket, Mango, Marker, Mattress, Meteorite, Microwave, Monitor, Motorcycle, Mountain, Necklace, Nightstand, Ocean, Onion, Orange, Paintbrush, Painting, Pan, Pants, Paper, Peach, Peas, Pen, Pencil, Pendant, Piano, Pillow, Pineapple, Plate, Pliers, Potato, Printer, Puzzle, Rabbit, Rake, Refrigerator, Ring, River, Rock, Saw, Saxophone, Scarf, Scissors, Scooter, Screwdriver, Sculpture, Sea, Sharpie, Sheep, Ship, Shirt, Shoes, Shovel, Skirt, Smartphone, Soccer ball, Socks, Spinach, Spoon, Stapler, Strawberry, Table, Television, Tennis ball, Tennis racket, Tiger, Tomato, Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Train, Tree, Trombone, Truck, Trumpet, Violin, Volleyball, Watch, Watering can, Watermelon, Whisk, Wrench. \n\nOne of the 157 words is the answer word. You can ask up to 20 yes/no questions to identify the answer word. You will get a Yes, No or Invalid feedback for each question. Note, you can NOT ask questions about the letters of the answer word.

This strategy works best when the candidate pool is large and diverse. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Start with the full list of candidate words.\n2. Ask a question that splits the list into two roughly equal groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n3. Based on the response, eliminate the irrelevant group.\n4. Repeat the process, narrowing down the pool with each question by targeting specific subcategories (e.g., \"Is the answer word related to transportation?\").\n5. Continue until the pool is small enough to identify the answer word directly.\n</example>\n** Count: 6\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nRecreational and Sports Filtering: When the answer word is related to recreational activities or sports, focus on identifying the specific category (e.g., ball sports, racket sports, etc.) and then narrow down further based on equipment or traits. (Reference: Game #4, Game #6)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Ask if the answer word is related to recreational activities or sports.\n2. Narrow down by type of sport (e.g., \"Is it related to ball sports?\" or \"Is it related to racket sports?\").\n3. Further filter by specific sports (e.g., \"Is it related to volleyball?\" or \"Is it related to baseball?\").\n4. Use these filters to systematically eliminate candidates until the answer word is identified.\n</example>\n** Count: 2\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nSpecific Trait Identification: Focus on unique or defining traits of the remaining candidates to pinpoint the answer word. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Once the pool is small (e.g., 5-10 candidates), identify unique traits of each remaining candidate.\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is the answer word powered by pedaling?\").\n3. Use the responses to eliminate all candidates except the one that matches the traits.\n</example>\n** Count: 6\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nExhaustive Elimination: When the pool is small but the answer is unclear, systematically eliminate all remaining candidates by asking direct questions about their defining traits. (Reference: Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Identify the remaining candidates in the pool.\n2. For each candidate, ask a direct question about a defining trait (e.g., \"Is the answer word a scooter?\" or \"Is the answer word a motorcycle?\").\n3. Continue until only one candidate remains.\n4. Avoid skipping over candidates or assuming traits without confirmation.\n</example>\n** Count: 4\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nInvalid Question Handling: Avoid asking questions that are ambiguous or prone to invalid responses. If a question is invalid, reframe it to ensure clarity and alignment with the game's rules. (Reference: Game #2, Game #3)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Before asking a question, ensure it is clear and unambiguous (e.g., avoid asking \"Is it motorized?\" if the term \"motorized\" might be interpreted differently).\n2. If an invalid response is received, reframe the question to clarify (e.g., \"Does the answer word have an engine?\" instead of \"Is it motorized?\").\n3. Use the reframed question to gather the necessary information without ambiguity.\n4. Avoid repeating invalid questions to prevent wasting opportunities.\n</example>\n** Count: 2\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nCleaning and Maintenance Filtering: When the answer word is related to cleaning or maintenance, focus on identifying the specific type of cleaning or maintenance task and the tools or items associated with it. (Reference: Game #5)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Ask if the answer word is related to cleaning or maintenance.\n2. Narrow down by type of cleaning task (e.g., \"Is it used for cleaning floors?\" or \"Is it used for cleaning surfaces?\").\n3. Further filter by type of cleaning tool or item (e.g., \"Is it a type of cloth?\" or \"Is it a type of liquid?\").\n4. Use these filters to systematically eliminate candidates until the answer word is identified.\n</example>\n** Count: 1\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nBall Sports Filtering: When the answer word is related to ball sports, focus on identifying the type of ball and its specific use in sports. (Reference: Game #6)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Ask if the answer word is related to ball sports.\n2. Narrow down by the type of ball (e.g., \"Is it a large ball like a basketball or soccer ball?\" or \"Is it a small ball like a baseball or tennis ball?\").\n3. Further filter by the sport the ball is used in (e.g., \"Is it used in a sport involving a racket or club?\" or \"Is it used in baseball or softball?\").\n4. Use these filters to systematically eliminate candidates until the answer word is identified.\n</example>\n** Count: 1\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nHierarchical Questioning Framework: Structure questions in a hierarchical manner, starting with broad categories and progressively narrowing down to specific traits. This ensures maximum efficiency and minimizes wasted questions. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Begin with a broad question that splits the candidate pool into two large groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n2. Follow up with questions that progressively narrow down the pool (e.g., \"Is the answer word related to transportation?\" \u2192 \"Does it operate on land?\" \u2192 \"Does it have two wheels?\").\n3. Once the pool is small, switch to specific trait-based questions to identify the answer word directly.\n</example>\n** Count: 6\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nEfficiency Maximization: Aim to eliminate the largest possible group of candidates with each question. Avoid overly specific questions early in the game. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Analyze the candidate pool and identify the largest logical group.\n2. Formulate a question that targets this group (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\" eliminates all non-living things if the answer is No).\n3. Repeat the process, ensuring each question eliminates a significant portion of the remaining pool.\n4. Transition to specific questions only when the pool is sufficiently small.\n</example>\n** Count: 6\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nTrait-Based Elimination: Use questions targeting specific traits to eliminate candidates systematically. This strategy is particularly useful when the pool is small or when dealing with objects or animals with distinct features. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Identify traits that are unique to subsets of the remaining candidates (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is it powered by pedaling?\").\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits to eliminate candidates that do not match.\n3. Continue until only one candidate remains.\n</example>\n** Count: 6\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAvoiding Over-Narrowing: Avoid prematurely narrowing down the pool to a single category without sufficient evidence. Keep options open until enough traits are confirmed. (Reference: Game #2, Game #3, Game #5)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Avoid assuming the answer word belongs to a specific subcategory too early (e.g., assuming \"bicycle\" without confirming other possibilities like \"motorcycle\").\n2. Ask broader questions to confirm the category (e.g., \"Is it powered by pedaling?\" \u2192 \"Is it powered by an engine?\").\n3. Only narrow down to a single candidate when sufficient evidence has been gathered.\n</example>\n** Count: 3\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAmbiguity Avoidance: Ensure clarity in phrasing questions to avoid invalid responses or misinterpretation.

(Reference: Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #7)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Identify the remaining candidates in the pool.\n2. For each candidate, ask a direct question about a defining trait (e.g., \"Is the answer word a scooter?\" or \"Is the answer word a smartphone?\").\n3. Continue until only one candidate remains.\n4. Avoid skipping over candidates or assuming traits without confirmation.\n</example>\n** Count: 5\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nInvalid Question Handling: Avoid asking questions that are ambiguous or prone to invalid responses. If a question is invalid, reframe it to ensure clarity and alignment with the game's rules. (Reference: Game #2, Game #3)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Before asking a question, ensure it is clear and unambiguous (e.g., avoid asking \"Is it motorized?\" if the term \"motorized\" might be interpreted differently).\n2. If an invalid response is received, reframe the question to clarify (e.g., \"Does the answer word have an engine?\" instead of \"Is it motorized?\").\n3.

(Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6, Game #7)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Start with the full list of candidate words.\n2. Ask a question that splits the list into two roughly equal groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n3. Based on the response, eliminate the irrelevant group.\n4. Repeat the process, narrowing down the pool with each question by targeting specific subcategories (e.g., \"Is the answer word related to transportation?\").\n5. Continue until the pool is small enough to identify the answer word directly.\n</example>\n** Count: 7\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nSpecific Trait Identification: Focus on unique or defining traits of the remaining candidates to pinpoint the answer word. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6, Game #7)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Once the pool is small (e.g., 5-10 candidates), identify unique traits of each remaining candidate.\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is the answer word powered by pedaling?\").\n3. Use the responses to eliminate all candidates except the one that matches the traits.\n</example>\n** Count: 7\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nExhaustive Elimination: When the pool is small but the answer is unclear, systematically eliminate all remaining candidates by asking direct questions about their defining traits. (Reference: Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #7)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Identify the remaining candidates in the pool.\n2. For each candidate, ask a direct question about a defining trait (e.g., \"Is the answer word a scooter?\" or \"Is the answer word a smartphone?\").\n3. Continue until only one candidate remains.\n4. Avoid skipping over candidates or assuming traits without confirmation.\n</example>\n** Count: 5\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nInvalid Question Handling: Avoid asking questions that are ambiguous or prone to invalid responses. If a question is invalid, reframe it to ensure clarity and alignment with the game's rules. (Reference: Game #2, Game #3)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Before asking a question, ensure it is clear and unambiguous (e.g., avoid asking \"Is it motorized?\" if the term \"motorized\" might be interpreted differently).\n2. If an invalid response is received, reframe the question to clarify (e.g., \"Does the answer word have an engine?\" instead of \"Is it motorized?\").\n3. Use the reframed question to gather the necessary information without ambiguity.\n4. Avoid repeating invalid questions to prevent wasting opportunities.\n</example>\n** Count: 2\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nEntertainment and Leisure Filtering: When the answer word is related to entertainment or leisure activities, focus on identifying the specific type of activity or device. (Reference: Game #7)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Ask if the answer word is related to entertainment or leisure activities.\n2. Narrow down by type of device or activity (e.g., \"Is it an electronic device?\" \u2192 \"Is it used for watching visual content?\" \u2192 \"Is it used for listening to audio content?\").\n3. Further filter by specific use case (e.g., \"Is it used for gaming?\" or \"Is it a smartphone?\").\n4. Use these filters to systematically eliminate candidates until the answer word is identified.\n</example>\n** Count: 1\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAvoiding Over-Narrowing: Avoid prematurely narrowing down the pool to a single category without sufficient evidence. Keep options open until enough traits are confirmed. (Reference: Game #2, Game #3, Game #5, Game #7)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Avoid assuming the answer word belongs to a specific subcategory too early (e.g., assuming \"smartphone\" without confirming other possibilities like \"camera\").\n2. Ask broader questions to confirm the category (e.g., \"Is it an electronic device?\" \u2192 \"Is it used for gaming or interactive activities?\").\n3. Only narrow down to a single candidate when sufficient evidence has been gathered.\n</example>\n** Count: 4\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nHierarchical Questioning Framework: Structure questions in a hierarchical manner, starting with broad categories and progressively narrowing down to specific traits. This ensures maximum efficiency and minimizes wasted questions. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6, Game #7)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Begin with a broad question that splits the candidate pool into two large groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n2. Follow up with questions that progressively narrow down the pool (e.g., \"Is the answer word related to transportation?\" \u2192 \"Does it operate on land?\" \u2192 \"Does it have two wheels?\").\n3. Once the pool is small, switch to specific trait-based questions to identify the answer word directly.\n</example>\n** Count: 7\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nEfficiency Maximization: Aim to eliminate the largest possible group of candidates with each question. Avoid overly specific questions early in the game. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6, Game #7)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Analyze the candidate pool and identify the largest logical group.\n2. Formulate a question that targets this group (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\" eliminates all non-living things if the answer is No).\n3. Repeat the process, ensuring each question eliminates a significant portion of the remaining pool.\n4. Transition to specific questions only when the pool is sufficiently small.\n</example>\n** Count: 7\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nTrait-Based Elimination: Use questions targeting specific traits to eliminate candidates systematically. This strategy is particularly useful when the pool is small or when dealing with objects or animals with distinct features. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6, Game #7)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Identify traits that are unique to subsets of the remaining candidates (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is it powered by pedaling?\").\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits to eliminate candidates that do not match.\n3. Continue until only one candidate remains.\n</example>\n** Count: 7\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAmbiguity Avoidance: Ensure clarity in phrasing questions to avoid invalid responses or misinterpretation.

This strategy works best when the candidate pool is large and diverse. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6, Game #7)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Start with the full list of candidate words.\n2. Ask a question that splits the list into two roughly equal groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n3. Based on the response, eliminate the irrelevant group.\n4. Repeat the process, narrowing down the pool with each question by targeting specific subcategories (e.g., \"Is the answer word related to transportation?\").\n5. Continue until the pool is small enough to identify the answer word directly.\n</example>\n** Count: 7\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nSpecific Trait Identification: Focus on unique or defining traits of the remaining candidates to pinpoint the answer word. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6, Game #7)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Once the pool is small (e.g., 5-10 candidates), identify unique traits of each remaining candidate.\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is the answer word powered by pedaling?\").\n3. Use the responses to eliminate all candidates except the one that matches the traits.\n</example>\n** Count: 7\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nExhaustive Elimination: When the pool is small but the answer is unclear, systematically eliminate all remaining candidates by asking direct questions about their defining traits. (Reference: Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #7)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Identify the remaining candidates in the pool.\n2. For each candidate, ask a direct question about a defining trait (e.g., \"Is the answer word a scooter?\" or \"Is the answer word a smartphone?\").\n3. Continue until only one candidate remains.\n4. Avoid skipping over candidates or assuming traits without confirmation.\n</example>\n** Count: 5\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nInvalid Question Handling: Avoid asking questions that are ambiguous or prone to invalid responses. If a question is invalid, reframe it to ensure clarity and alignment with the game's rules. (Reference: Game #2, Game #3)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Before asking a question, ensure it is clear and unambiguous (e.g., avoid asking \"Is it motorized?\" if the term \"motorized\" might be interpreted differently).\n2. If an invalid response is received, reframe the question to clarify (e.g., \"Does the answer word have an engine?\" instead of \"Is it motorized?\").\n3. Use the reframed question to gather the necessary information without ambiguity.\n4. Avoid repeating invalid questions to prevent wasting opportunities.\n</example>\n** Count: 2\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nEntertainment and Leisure Filtering: When the answer word is related to entertainment or leisure activities, focus on identifying the specific type of activity or device. (Reference: Game #7)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Ask if the answer word is related to entertainment or leisure activities.\n2. Narrow down by type of device or activity (e.g., \"Is it an electronic device?\" \u2192 \"Is it used for watching visual content?\" \u2192 \"Is it used for listening to audio content?\").\n3. Further filter by specific use case (e.g., \"Is it used for gaming?\" or \"Is it a smartphone?\").\n4. Use these filters to systematically eliminate candidates until the answer word is identified.\n</example>\n** Count: 1\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAvoiding Over-Narrowing: Avoid prematurely narrowing down the pool to a single category without sufficient evidence. Keep options open until enough traits are confirmed. (Reference: Game #2, Game #3, Game #5, Game #7)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Avoid assuming the answer word belongs to a specific subcategory too early (e.g., assuming \"smartphone\" without confirming other possibilities like \"camera\").\n2. Ask broader questions to confirm the category (e.g., \"Is it an electronic device?\" \u2192 \"Is it used for gaming or interactive activities?\").\n3. Only narrow down to a single candidate when sufficient evidence has been gathered.\n</example>\n** Count: 4\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nHierarchical Questioning Framework: Structure questions in a hierarchical manner, starting with broad categories and progressively narrowing down to specific traits. This ensures maximum efficiency and minimizes wasted questions. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6, Game #7)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Begin with a broad question that splits the candidate pool into two large groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n2. Follow up with questions that progressively narrow down the pool (e.g., \"Is the answer word related to transportation?\" \u2192 \"Does it operate on land?\" \u2192 \"Does it have two wheels?\").\n3. Once the pool is small, switch to specific trait-based questions to identify the answer word directly.\n</example>\n** Count: 7\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nEfficiency Maximization: Aim to eliminate the largest possible group of candidates with each question. Avoid overly specific questions early in the game. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6, Game #7)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Analyze the candidate pool and identify the largest logical group.\n2. Formulate a question that targets this group (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\" eliminates all non-living things if the answer is No).\n3. Repeat the process, ensuring each question eliminates a significant portion of the remaining pool.\n4. Transition to specific questions only when the pool is sufficiently small.\n</example>\n** Count: 7\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nTrait-Based Elimination: Use questions targeting specific traits to eliminate candidates systematically. This strategy is particularly useful when the pool is small or when dealing with objects or animals with distinct features. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6, Game #7)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Identify traits that are unique to subsets of the remaining candidates (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is it powered by pedaling?\").\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits to eliminate candidates that do not match.\n3. Continue until only one candidate remains.\n</example>\n** Count: 7\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAmbiguity Avoidance: Ensure clarity in phrasing questions to avoid invalid responses or misinterpretation. This is especially critical when dealing with compound or plural terms. (Reference: Game #3)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Avoid ambiguous phrasing (e.g., \"Is the answer word chopsticks?\" may lead to invalid responses due to plurality).\n2. Clarify terms explicitly (e.g., \"Is the answer word a pair of chopsticks?\" or \"Is the answer word a single chopstick?\").\n3. Reframe questions as needed to ensure alignment with the game's rules.\n4.

Purpose and Goals\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you are tasked with creating a continuously evolving reference designed to help solve a wide variety of tasks. The cheatsheet's purpose is to consolidate verified solutions, reusable strategies, and critical insights into a single, well-structured resource.\n\n- The cheatsheet should include quick, accurate, reliable, and practical solutions to a range of technical and creative challenges. \n- After seeing each case, you should improve the content of the cheatsheet, synthesizing lessons, insights, tricks, and errors learned from past problems and adapting to new challenges.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Core Responsibilities\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you should:\n   - Curate and preserve knolwedge: Select and document only the most relevant, most useful, and most actionable solutions and strategies, while preserving old content of the cheatsheet.\n   - Maintain accuracy: Ensure that all entries in the cheatsheet are accurate, clear, and well-contextualized. \n   - Refine and update content: Continuously update and improve the content of the cheatsheet by incorporating new insights and solutions, removing repetitions or trivial information, and adding efficient solutions.\n   - Ensure practicality and comprehensiveness: Provide critical and informative examples, as well as pseudocodes outlining steps to solve problems efficiently, and actionable guidelines. \n\nBefore updating the cheatsheet, however, you should first assess the correctness of the provided solution and strategically incorporate insights, solutions, and pseudocodes into the new cheatsheet. Always aim to preserve and keep correct, useful, and illustrative solutions and strategies for future cheatsheets.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Principles and Best Practices\n1. Accuracy and Relevance:\n   - Only include solutions and strategies that have been tested and proven effective.\n   - Clearly state any assumptions, limitations, or dependencies (e.g., specific solution hacks).\n\n2. Iterative Refinement:\n   - Continuously improve the cheatsheet by synthesizing both old and new solutions, refining explanations, and removing redundancies.\n   - Rather than deleting old content and writing new content each time, consider ways to maintain table content and synthesize information from multiple solutions.\n   - After solving a new problem, document any reusable strategies, edge cases, optimization techniques, or pseudocodes. \n\n3. Clarity and Usability:\n   - Write concise, actioanble, well-structured entries.\n   - Focus on key insights or strategies that make solutions correct and effective.\n\n4. Reusability:\n   - Provide clear solutions, meta strategies, and reasoning pseudocodes that are easily adaptable to different contexts.\n   - Avoid trivial content; focus on non-obvious, critical solution details and approaches.\n   - Make sure to add as many examples as you can in the cheatsheet. \n   - Any useful, efficient, generalizable, and illustrative solutions to the previous problems should be included in the cheatsheet.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Cheatsheet Structure\nThe cheatsheet can be divided into the following sections:\n\n1. Solutions, and Implementation Patterns:\n   - Document solution templates, and reusable reasoning pseudocodes.\n   - Include descriptions, annotated examples, and potential pitfalls, albeit succinctly.\n\n2. [OPTIONAL] Edge Cases and Validation Traps:\n   - Catalog scenarios that commonly cause errors or unexpected behavior.\n   - Provide checks, validations, or alternative approaches to handle them.\n\n3. General Meta-Reasoning Strategies:\n   - Describe high-level problem-solving frameworks and heuristics\n   - Provide concrete yet succinct step-by-step guides for tackling complex problems.\n\n4. Implement a Usage Counter\n   - Each entry must include a usage count: Increase the count every time a strategy is successfully used in problem-solving.\n   - Use the count to prioritize frequently used solutions over rarely applied ones.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Formatting Guidelines\nUse the following structure for each memory item:\n\n```\n<memory_item>\n<description>\n[Briefly describe the problem context, purpose, and key aspects of the solution.] (Refence: Q1, Q2, Q6, etc.)\n</description>\n<example>\n[Provide a worked-out solution, efficient strategy, or well-documented reasoning pseudocode.]\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count:  [Number of times this strategy has been used to solve a problem.]\n\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n[...]\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n```\n\n- Tagging: Use references like `(Q14)` or `(Q22)` to link entries to their originating contexts.\n- Grouping: Organize entries into logical sections and subsections.\n- Prioritizing: incorporate efficient algorithmic solutions, tricks, and strategies into the cheatsheet.\n- Diversity: Have as many useful and relevant memory items as possible to guide the model to tackle future questions.\n\nN.B. Keep in mind that once the cheatsheet is updated, any previous content not directly included will be lost and cannot be retrieved. Therefore, make sure to explicitly copy any (or all) relevant information from the previous cheatsheet to the new cheatsheet!!!\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Cheatsheet Template\nUse the following format for creating and updating the cheatsheet:\n\nNEW CHEATSHEET:\n```\n<cheatsheet>\n\nVersion: [Version Number]\n\nSOLUTIONS, AND IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS, AND PSEUDOCODES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n</cheatsheet>\n```\n\nN.B.

Purpose and Goals\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you are tasked with creating a continuously evolving reference designed to help solve a wide variety of tasks. The cheatsheet's purpose is to consolidate verified solutions, reusable strategies, and critical insights into a single, well-structured resource.\n\n- The cheatsheet should include quick, accurate, reliable, and practical solutions to a range of technical and creative challenges. \n- After seeing each case, you should improve the content of the cheatsheet, synthesizing lessons, insights, tricks, and errors learned from past problems and adapting to new challenges.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Core Responsibilities\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you should:\n   - Curate and preserve knolwedge: Select and document only the most relevant, most useful, and most actionable solutions and strategies, while preserving old content of the cheatsheet.\n   - Maintain accuracy: Ensure that all entries in the cheatsheet are accurate, clear, and well-contextualized. \n   - Refine and update content: Continuously update and improve the content of the cheatsheet by incorporating new insights and solutions, removing repetitions or trivial information, and adding efficient solutions.\n   - Ensure practicality and comprehensiveness: Provide critical and informative examples, as well as pseudocodes outlining steps to solve problems efficiently, and actionable guidelines. \n\nBefore updating the cheatsheet, however, you should first assess the correctness of the provided solution and strategically incorporate insights, solutions, and pseudocodes into the new cheatsheet. Always aim to preserve and keep correct, useful, and illustrative solutions and strategies for future cheatsheets.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Principles and Best Practices\n1. Accuracy and Relevance:\n   - Only include solutions and strategies that have been tested and proven effective.\n   - Clearly state any assumptions, limitations, or dependencies (e.g., specific solution hacks).\n\n2. Iterative Refinement:\n   - Continuously improve the cheatsheet by synthesizing both old and new solutions, refining explanations, and removing redundancies.\n   - Rather than deleting old content and writing new content each time, consider ways to maintain table content and synthesize information from multiple solutions.\n   - After solving a new problem, document any reusable strategies, edge cases, optimization techniques, or pseudocodes. \n\n3. Clarity and Usability:\n   - Write concise, actioanble, well-structured entries.\n   - Focus on key insights or strategies that make solutions correct and effective.\n\n4. Reusability:\n   - Provide clear solutions, meta strategies, and reasoning pseudocodes that are easily adaptable to different contexts.\n   - Avoid trivial content; focus on non-obvious, critical solution details and approaches.\n   - Make sure to add as many examples as you can in the cheatsheet. \n   - Any useful, efficient, generalizable, and illustrative solutions to the previous problems should be included in the cheatsheet.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Cheatsheet Structure\nThe cheatsheet can be divided into the following sections:\n\n1. Solutions, and Implementation Patterns:\n   - Document solution templates, and reusable reasoning pseudocodes.\n   - Include descriptions, annotated examples, and potential pitfalls, albeit succinctly.\n\n2. [OPTIONAL] Edge Cases and Validation Traps:\n   - Catalog scenarios that commonly cause errors or unexpected behavior.\n   - Provide checks, validations, or alternative approaches to handle them.\n\n3. General Meta-Reasoning Strategies:\n   - Describe high-level problem-solving frameworks and heuristics\n   - Provide concrete yet succinct step-by-step guides for tackling complex problems.\n\n4. Implement a Usage Counter\n   - Each entry must include a usage count: Increase the count every time a strategy is successfully used in problem-solving.\n   - Use the count to prioritize frequently used solutions over rarely applied ones.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Formatting Guidelines\nUse the following structure for each memory item:\n\n```\n<memory_item>\n<description>\n[Briefly describe the problem context, purpose, and key aspects of the solution.] (Refence: Q1, Q2, Q6, etc.)\n</description>\n<example>\n[Provide a worked-out solution, efficient strategy, or well-documented reasoning pseudocode.]\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count:  [Number of times this strategy has been used to solve a problem.]\n\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n[...]\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n```\n\n- Tagging: Use references like `(Q14)` or `(Q22)` to link entries to their originating contexts.\n- Grouping: Organize entries into logical sections and subsections.\n- Prioritizing: incorporate efficient algorithmic solutions, tricks, and strategies into the cheatsheet.\n- Diversity: Have as many useful and relevant memory items as possible to guide the model to tackle future questions.\n\nN.B. Keep in mind that once the cheatsheet is updated, any previous content not directly included will be lost and cannot be retrieved. Therefore, make sure to explicitly copy any (or all) relevant information from the previous cheatsheet to the new cheatsheet!!!\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Cheatsheet Template\nUse the following format for creating and updating the cheatsheet:\n\nNEW CHEATSHEET:\n```\n<cheatsheet>\n\nVersion: [Version Number]\n\nSOLUTIONS, AND IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS, AND PSEUDOCODES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n</cheatsheet>\n```\n\nN.B. Make sure that all information related to the cheatsheet is wrapped inside the <cheatsheet> block. The cheatsheet can be as long as circa 2000 words.\n\n-----\n-----\n\nYou are playing the game Twenty Questions. \n\nIn this game, there are 157 candidate words: Airplane, Apple, Banana, Baseball, Baseball bat, Basketball, Battery, Bear, Bed, Belt, Blender, Boat, Bookcase, Boots, Bowl, Bracelet, Broccoli, Brooch, Bus, Bush, Cactus, Calculator, Calendar, Camera, Cantaloupe, Canvas, Car, Carrot, Cat, Celery, Chair, Chopstick, Clarinet, Computer, Computer keyboard, Cooking pot, Corn, Couch, Cow, Cucumber, Cup, Desk, Diary, Dog, Doll, Dress, Dresser, Drill, Drum, Earring, Elephant, Eraser, Flute, Football, Forest, Fork, Gloves, Glue, Golf ball, Grape, Guitar, Hairclip, Hammer, Harp, Hat, Headphone, Helicopter, Helmet, Horse, Jacket, Key, Kite, Knife, Lake, Lawn mower, Lego, Lion, Locket, Mango, Marker, Mattress, Meteorite, Microwave, Monitor, Motorcycle, Mountain, Necklace, Nightstand, Ocean, Onion, Orange, Paintbrush, Painting, Pan, Pants, Paper, Peach, Peas, Pen, Pencil, Pendant, Piano, Pillow, Pineapple, Plate, Pliers, Potato, Printer, Puzzle, Rabbit, Rake, Refrigerator, Ring, River, Rock, Saw, Saxophone, Scarf, Scissors, Scooter, Screwdriver, Sculpture, Sea, Sharpie, Sheep, Ship, Shirt, Shoes, Shovel, Skirt, Smartphone, Soccer ball, Socks, Spinach, Spoon, Stapler, Strawberry, Table, Television, Tennis ball, Tennis racket, Tiger, Tomato, Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Train, Tree, Trombone, Truck, Trumpet, Violin, Volleyball, Watch, Watering can, Watermelon, Whisk, Wrench. \n\nOne of the 157 words is the answer word. You can ask up to 20 yes/no questions to identify the answer word. You will get a Yes, No or Invalid feedback for each question. Note, you can NOT ask questions about the letters of the answer word. Questions can only be asked around semantics.\n\n-----\n-----\n\n## PREVIOUS CHEATSHEET\n\nVersion: 8.0\n\nSOLUTIONS, AND IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS, AND PSEUDOCODES\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nBinary Categorization Strategy: Divide the candidate pool into two large, distinct categories with each question to maximize efficiency. This strategy works best when the candidate pool is large and diverse. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6, Game #7, Game #8)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Start with the full list of candidate words.\n2. Ask a question that splits the list into two roughly equal groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n3. Based on the response, eliminate the irrelevant group.\n4. Repeat the process, narrowing down the pool with each question by targeting specific subcategories (e.g., \"Is the answer word related to transportation?\").\n5. Continue until the pool is small enough to identify the answer word directly.\n</example>\n** Count: 8\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nSpecific Trait Identification: Focus on unique or defining traits of the remaining candidates to pinpoint the answer word. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6, Game #7, Game #8)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Once the pool is small (e.g., 5-10 candidates), identify unique traits of each remaining candidate.\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is the answer word powered by pedaling?\").\n3. Use the responses to eliminate all candidates except the one that matches the traits.\n</example>\n** Count: 8\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nExhaustive Elimination: When the pool is small but the answer is unclear, systematically eliminate all remaining candidates by asking direct questions about their defining traits. (Reference: Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #7, Game #8)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Identify the remaining candidates in the pool.\n2. For each candidate, ask a direct question about a defining trait (e.g., \"Is the answer word a scooter?\" or \"Is the answer word a smartphone?\").\n3. Continue until only one candidate remains.\n4. Avoid skipping over candidates or assuming traits without confirmation.\n</example>\n** Count: 6\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nInvalid Question Handling: Avoid asking questions that are ambiguous or prone to invalid responses. If a question is invalid, reframe it to ensure clarity and alignment with the game's rules. (Reference: Game #2, Game #3, Game #8)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Before asking a question, ensure it is clear and unambiguous (e.g., avoid asking \"Is it motorized?\" if the term \"motorized\" might be interpreted differently).\n2. If an invalid response is received, reframe the question to clarify (e.g., \"Does the answer word have an engine?\" instead of \"Is it motorized?\").\n3. Use the reframed question to gather the necessary information without ambiguity.\n4. Avoid repeating invalid questions to prevent wasting opportunities.\n</example>\n** Count: 3\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAvoiding Over-Narrowing: Avoid prematurely narrowing down the pool to a single category without sufficient evidence. Keep options open until enough traits are confirmed. (Reference: Game #2, Game #3, Game #5, Game #7, Game #8)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Avoid assuming the answer word belongs to a specific subcategory too early (e.g., assuming \"smartphone\" without confirming other possibilities like \"camera\").\n2. Ask broader questions to confirm the category (e.g., \"Is it an electronic device?\" \u2192 \"Is it used for gaming or interactive activities?\").\n3. Only narrow down to a single candidate when sufficient evidence has been gathered.\n</example>\n** Count: 5\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nTool and Instrument Categorization: When the answer word is a tool or instrument, focus on identifying its primary use case (e.g., construction, repair, artistic activities, etc.). (Reference: Game #8)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Ask if the answer word is a tool or instrument.\n2. Narrow down by primary use case (e.g., \"Is it used for construction or repair work?\" \u2192 \"Is it used for artistic or creative activities?\" \u2192 \"Is it used for cutting or slicing?\").\n3. Further filter by specific traits (e.g., \"Does it have blades?\" or \"Is it motorized?\").\n4. Use these filters to systematically eliminate candidates until the answer word is identified.\n</example>\n** Count: 1\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nHierarchical Questioning Framework: Structure questions in a hierarchical manner, starting with broad categories and progressively narrowing down to specific traits. This ensures maximum efficiency and minimizes wasted questions. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6, Game #7, Game #8)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Begin with a broad question that splits the candidate pool into two large groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n2. Follow up with questions that progressively narrow down the pool (e.g., \"Is the answer word related to transportation?\" \u2192 \"Does it operate on land?\" \u2192 \"Does it have two wheels?\").\n3. Once the pool is small, switch to specific trait-based questions to identify the answer word directly.\n</example>\n** Count: 8\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nEfficiency Maximization: Aim to eliminate the largest possible group of candidates with each question. Avoid overly specific questions early in the game. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6, Game #7, Game #8)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Analyze the candidate pool and identify the largest logical group.\n2. Formulate a question that targets this group (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\" eliminates all non-living things if the answer is No).\n3. Repeat the process, ensuring each question eliminates a significant portion of the remaining pool.\n4. Transition to specific questions only when the pool is sufficiently small.\n</example>\n** Count: 8\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nTrait-Based Elimination: Use questions targeting specific traits to eliminate candidates systematically. This strategy is particularly useful when the pool is small or when dealing with objects or animals with distinct features. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6, Game #7, Game #8)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Identify traits that are unique to subsets of the remaining candidates (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is it powered by pedaling?\").\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits to eliminate candidates that do not match.\n3. Continue until only one candidate remains.\n</example>\n** Count: 8\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAmbiguity Avoidance: Ensure clarity in phrasing questions to avoid invalid responses or misinterpretation. This is especially critical when dealing with compound or plural terms. (Reference: Game #3, Game #8)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Avoid ambiguous phrasing (e.g., \"Is the answer word chopsticks?\" may lead to invalid responses due to plurality).\n2. Clarify terms explicitly (e.g., \"Is the answer word a pair of chopsticks?\" or \"Is the answer word a single chopstick?\").\n3. Reframe questions as needed to ensure alignment with the game's rules.\n4.

Purpose and Goals\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you are tasked with creating a continuously evolving reference designed to help solve a wide variety of tasks. The cheatsheet's purpose is to consolidate verified solutions, reusable strategies, and critical insights into a single, well-structured resource.\n\n- The cheatsheet should include quick, accurate, reliable, and practical solutions to a range of technical and creative challenges. \n- After seeing each case, you should improve the content of the cheatsheet, synthesizing lessons, insights, tricks, and errors learned from past problems and adapting to new challenges.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Core Responsibilities\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you should:\n   - Curate and preserve knolwedge: Select and document only the most relevant, most useful, and most actionable solutions and strategies, while preserving old content of the cheatsheet.\n   - Maintain accuracy: Ensure that all entries in the cheatsheet are accurate, clear, and well-contextualized. \n   - Refine and update content: Continuously update and improve the content of the cheatsheet by incorporating new insights and solutions, removing repetitions or trivial information, and adding efficient solutions.\n   - Ensure practicality and comprehensiveness: Provide critical and informative examples, as well as pseudocodes outlining steps to solve problems efficiently, and actionable guidelines. \n\nBefore updating the cheatsheet, however, you should first assess the correctness of the provided solution and strategically incorporate insights, solutions, and pseudocodes into the new cheatsheet. Always aim to preserve and keep correct, useful, and illustrative solutions and strategies for future cheatsheets.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Principles and Best Practices\n1. Accuracy and Relevance:\n   - Only include solutions and strategies that have been tested and proven effective.\n   - Clearly state any assumptions, limitations, or dependencies (e.g., specific solution hacks).\n\n2. Iterative Refinement:\n   - Continuously improve the cheatsheet by synthesizing both old and new solutions, refining explanations, and removing redundancies.\n   - Rather than deleting old content and writing new content each time, consider ways to maintain table content and synthesize information from multiple solutions.\n   - After solving a new problem, document any reusable strategies, edge cases, optimization techniques, or pseudocodes. \n\n3. Clarity and Usability:\n   - Write concise, actioanble, well-structured entries.\n   - Focus on key insights or strategies that make solutions correct and effective.\n\n4. Reusability:\n   - Provide clear solutions, meta strategies, and reasoning pseudocodes that are easily adaptable to different contexts.\n   - Avoid trivial content; focus on non-obvious, critical solution details and approaches.\n   - Make sure to add as many examples as you can in the cheatsheet. \n   - Any useful, efficient, generalizable, and illustrative solutions to the previous problems should be included in the cheatsheet.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Cheatsheet Structure\nThe cheatsheet can be divided into the following sections:\n\n1. Solutions, and Implementation Patterns:\n   - Document solution templates, and reusable reasoning pseudocodes.\n   - Include descriptions, annotated examples, and potential pitfalls, albeit succinctly.\n\n2. [OPTIONAL] Edge Cases and Validation Traps:\n   - Catalog scenarios that commonly cause errors or unexpected behavior.\n   - Provide checks, validations, or alternative approaches to handle them.\n\n3. General Meta-Reasoning Strategies:\n   - Describe high-level problem-solving frameworks and heuristics\n   - Provide concrete yet succinct step-by-step guides for tackling complex problems.\n\n4. Implement a Usage Counter\n   - Each entry must include a usage count: Increase the count every time a strategy is successfully used in problem-solving.\n   - Use the count to prioritize frequently used solutions over rarely applied ones.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Formatting Guidelines\nUse the following structure for each memory item:\n\n```\n<memory_item>\n<description>\n[Briefly describe the problem context, purpose, and key aspects of the solution.] (Refence: Q1, Q2, Q6, etc.)\n</description>\n<example>\n[Provide a worked-out solution, efficient strategy, or well-documented reasoning pseudocode.]\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count:  [Number of times this strategy has been used to solve a problem.]\n\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n[...]\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n```\n\n- Tagging: Use references like `(Q14)` or `(Q22)` to link entries to their originating contexts.\n- Grouping: Organize entries into logical sections and subsections.\n- Prioritizing: incorporate efficient algorithmic solutions, tricks, and strategies into the cheatsheet.\n- Diversity: Have as many useful and relevant memory items as possible to guide the model to tackle future questions.\n\nN.B. Keep in mind that once the cheatsheet is updated, any previous content not directly included will be lost and cannot be retrieved. Therefore, make sure to explicitly copy any (or all) relevant information from the previous cheatsheet to the new cheatsheet!!!\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Cheatsheet Template\nUse the following format for creating and updating the cheatsheet:\n\nNEW CHEATSHEET:\n```\n<cheatsheet>\n\nVersion: [Version Number]\n\nSOLUTIONS, AND IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS, AND PSEUDOCODES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n</cheatsheet>\n```\n\nN.B.

This strategy works best when the candidate pool is large and diverse. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6, Game #7, Game #8, Game #9, Game #10)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Start with the full list of candidate words.\n2. Ask a question that splits the list into two roughly equal groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n3. Based on the response, eliminate the irrelevant group.\n4. Repeat the process, narrowing down the pool with each question by targeting specific subcategories (e.g., \"Is the answer word related to transportation?\").\n5. Continue until the pool is small enough to identify the answer word directly.\n</example>\n** Count: 10\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nSpecific Trait Identification: Focus on unique or defining traits of the remaining candidates to pinpoint the answer word. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6, Game #7, Game #8, Game #9, Game #10)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Once the pool is small (e.g., 5-10 candidates), identify unique traits of each remaining candidate.\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is the answer word powered by pedaling?\").\n3. Use the responses to eliminate all candidates except the one that matches the traits.\n</example>\n** Count: 10\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nHierarchical Questioning for Living Things: When the answer word is a living thing, use a hierarchical approach to narrow down categories (e.g., animal vs. plant, domesticated vs. wild, etc.). (Reference: Game #9, Game #10)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Ask if the answer word is a living thing.\n2. If Yes, determine if it is an animal or plant.\n3. If it is an animal, ask if it is domesticated or wild.\n4. For domesticated animals, ask about their primary purpose (e.g., \"Is it used for farming or agricultural purposes?\" \u2192 \"Is it used for producing food?\").\n5. Continue narrowing down by specific traits (e.g., \"Is it primarily used for producing wool or fur?\" \u2192 \"Is it a small animal?\").\n6. Use these filters to systematically eliminate candidates until the answer word is identified.\n</example>\n** Count: 2\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nExhaustive Elimination: When the pool is small but the answer is unclear, systematically eliminate all remaining candidates by asking direct questions about their defining traits. (Reference: Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #7, Game #8, Game #10)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Identify the remaining candidates in the pool.\n2. For each candidate, ask a direct question about a defining trait (e.g., \"Is the answer word a scooter?\" or \"Is the answer word a smartphone?\").\n3. Continue until only one candidate remains.\n4. Avoid skipping over candidates or assuming traits without confirmation.\n</example>\n** Count: 7\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAvoiding Over-Narrowing: Avoid prematurely narrowing down the pool to a single category without sufficient evidence. Keep options open until enough traits are confirmed. (Reference: Game #2, Game #3, Game #5, Game #7, Game #8, Game #10)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Avoid assuming the answer word belongs to a specific subcategory too early (e.g., assuming \"smartphone\" without confirming other possibilities like \"camera\").\n2. Ask broader questions to confirm the category (e.g., \"Is it an electronic device?\" \u2192 \"Is it used for gaming or interactive activities?\").\n3. Only narrow down to a single candidate when sufficient evidence has been gathered.\n</example>\n** Count: 6\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nTool and Instrument Categorization: When the answer word is a tool or instrument, focus on identifying its primary use case (e.g., construction, repair, artistic activities, etc.). (Reference: Game #8)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Ask if the answer word is a tool or instrument.\n2. Narrow down by primary use case (e.g., \"Is it used for construction or repair work?\" \u2192 \"Is it used for artistic or creative activities?\" \u2192 \"Is it used for cutting or slicing?\").\n3. Further filter by specific traits (e.g., \"Does it have blades?\" or \"Is it motorized?\").\n4. Use these filters to systematically eliminate candidates until the answer word is identified.\n</example>\n** Count: 1\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nHierarchical Questioning Framework: Structure questions in a hierarchical manner, starting with broad categories and progressively narrowing down to specific traits. This ensures maximum efficiency and minimizes wasted questions. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6, Game #7, Game #8, Game #9, Game #10)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Begin with a broad question that splits the candidate pool into two large groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n2. Follow up with questions that progressively narrow down the pool (e.g., \"Is the answer word related to transportation?\" \u2192 \"Does it operate on land?\" \u2192 \"Does it have two wheels?\").\n3. Once the pool is small, switch to specific trait-based questions to identify the answer word directly.\n</example>\n** Count: 10\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nEfficiency Maximization: Aim to eliminate the largest possible group of candidates with each question. Avoid overly specific questions early in the game. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6, Game #7, Game #8, Game #9, Game #10)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Analyze the candidate pool and identify the largest logical group.\n2. Formulate a question that targets this group (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\" eliminates all non-living things if the answer is No).\n3. Repeat the process, ensuring each question eliminates a significant portion of the remaining pool.\n4. Transition to specific questions only when the pool is sufficiently small.\n</example>\n** Count: 10\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nTrait-Based Elimination: Use questions targeting specific traits to eliminate candidates systematically. This strategy is particularly useful when the pool is small or when dealing with objects or animals with distinct features. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6, Game #7, Game #8, Game #9, Game #10)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Identify traits that are unique to subsets of the remaining candidates (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is it powered by pedaling?\").\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits to eliminate candidates that do not match.\n3. Continue until only one candidate remains.\n</example>\n** Count: 10\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAmbiguity Avoidance: Ensure clarity in phrasing questions to avoid invalid responses or misinterpretation. This is especially critical when dealing with compound or plural terms. (Reference: Game #3, Game #8)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Avoid ambiguous phrasing (e.g., \"Is the answer word chopsticks?\" may lead to invalid responses due to plurality).\n2. Clarify terms explicitly (e.g., \"Is the answer word a pair of chopsticks?\" or \"Is the answer word a single chopstick?\").\n3.

Purpose and Goals\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you are tasked with creating a continuously evolving reference designed to help solve a wide variety of tasks. The cheatsheet's purpose is to consolidate verified solutions, reusable strategies, and critical insights into a single, well-structured resource.\n\n- The cheatsheet should include quick, accurate, reliable, and practical solutions to a range of technical and creative challenges. \n- After seeing each case, you should improve the content of the cheatsheet, synthesizing lessons, insights, tricks, and errors learned from past problems and adapting to new challenges.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Core Responsibilities\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you should:\n   - Curate and preserve knolwedge: Select and document only the most relevant, most useful, and most actionable solutions and strategies, while preserving old content of the cheatsheet.\n   - Maintain accuracy: Ensure that all entries in the cheatsheet are accurate, clear, and well-contextualized. \n   - Refine and update content: Continuously update and improve the content of the cheatsheet by incorporating new insights and solutions, removing repetitions or trivial information, and adding efficient solutions.\n   - Ensure practicality and comprehensiveness: Provide critical and informative examples, as well as pseudocodes outlining steps to solve problems efficiently, and actionable guidelines. \n\nBefore updating the cheatsheet, however, you should first assess the correctness of the provided solution and strategically incorporate insights, solutions, and pseudocodes into the new cheatsheet. Always aim to preserve and keep correct, useful, and illustrative solutions and strategies for future cheatsheets.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Principles and Best Practices\n1. Accuracy and Relevance:\n   - Only include solutions and strategies that have been tested and proven effective.\n   - Clearly state any assumptions, limitations, or dependencies (e.g., specific solution hacks).\n\n2. Iterative Refinement:\n   - Continuously improve the cheatsheet by synthesizing both old and new solutions, refining explanations, and removing redundancies.\n   - Rather than deleting old content and writing new content each time, consider ways to maintain table content and synthesize information from multiple solutions.\n   - After solving a new problem, document any reusable strategies, edge cases, optimization techniques, or pseudocodes. \n\n3. Clarity and Usability:\n   - Write concise, actioanble, well-structured entries.\n   - Focus on key insights or strategies that make solutions correct and effective.\n\n4. Reusability:\n   - Provide clear solutions, meta strategies, and reasoning pseudocodes that are easily adaptable to different contexts.\n   - Avoid trivial content; focus on non-obvious, critical solution details and approaches.\n   - Make sure to add as many examples as you can in the cheatsheet. \n   - Any useful, efficient, generalizable, and illustrative solutions to the previous problems should be included in the cheatsheet.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Cheatsheet Structure\nThe cheatsheet can be divided into the following sections:\n\n1. Solutions, and Implementation Patterns:\n   - Document solution templates, and reusable reasoning pseudocodes.\n   - Include descriptions, annotated examples, and potential pitfalls, albeit succinctly.\n\n2. [OPTIONAL] Edge Cases and Validation Traps:\n   - Catalog scenarios that commonly cause errors or unexpected behavior.\n   - Provide checks, validations, or alternative approaches to handle them.\n\n3. General Meta-Reasoning Strategies:\n   - Describe high-level problem-solving frameworks and heuristics\n   - Provide concrete yet succinct step-by-step guides for tackling complex problems.\n\n4. Implement a Usage Counter\n   - Each entry must include a usage count: Increase the count every time a strategy is successfully used in problem-solving.\n   - Use the count to prioritize frequently used solutions over rarely applied ones.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Formatting Guidelines\nUse the following structure for each memory item:\n\n```\n<memory_item>\n<description>\n[Briefly describe the problem context, purpose, and key aspects of the solution.] (Refence: Q1, Q2, Q6, etc.)\n</description>\n<example>\n[Provide a worked-out solution, efficient strategy, or well-documented reasoning pseudocode.]\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count:  [Number of times this strategy has been used to solve a problem.]\n\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n[...]\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n```\n\n- Tagging: Use references like `(Q14)` or `(Q22)` to link entries to their originating contexts.\n- Grouping: Organize entries into logical sections and subsections.\n- Prioritizing: incorporate efficient algorithmic solutions, tricks, and strategies into the cheatsheet.\n- Diversity: Have as many useful and relevant memory items as possible to guide the model to tackle future questions.\n\nN.B. Keep in mind that once the cheatsheet is updated, any previous content not directly included will be lost and cannot be retrieved. Therefore, make sure to explicitly copy any (or all) relevant information from the previous cheatsheet to the new cheatsheet!!!\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Cheatsheet Template\nUse the following format for creating and updating the cheatsheet:\n\nNEW CHEATSHEET:\n```\n<cheatsheet>\n\nVersion: [Version Number]\n\nSOLUTIONS, AND IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS, AND PSEUDOCODES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n</cheatsheet>\n```\n\nN.B.

The cheatsheet's purpose is to consolidate verified solutions, reusable strategies, and critical insights into a single, well-structured resource.\n\n- The cheatsheet should include quick, accurate, reliable, and practical solutions to a range of technical and creative challenges. \n- After seeing each case, you should improve the content of the cheatsheet, synthesizing lessons, insights, tricks, and errors learned from past problems and adapting to new challenges.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Core Responsibilities\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you should:\n   - Curate and preserve knolwedge: Select and document only the most relevant, most useful, and most actionable solutions and strategies, while preserving old content of the cheatsheet.\n   - Maintain accuracy: Ensure that all entries in the cheatsheet are accurate, clear, and well-contextualized. \n   - Refine and update content: Continuously update and improve the content of the cheatsheet by incorporating new insights and solutions, removing repetitions or trivial information, and adding efficient solutions.\n   - Ensure practicality and comprehensiveness: Provide critical and informative examples, as well as pseudocodes outlining steps to solve problems efficiently, and actionable guidelines. \n\nBefore updating the cheatsheet, however, you should first assess the correctness of the provided solution and strategically incorporate insights, solutions, and pseudocodes into the new cheatsheet. Always aim to preserve and keep correct, useful, and illustrative solutions and strategies for future cheatsheets.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Principles and Best Practices\n1. Accuracy and Relevance:\n   - Only include solutions and strategies that have been tested and proven effective.\n   - Clearly state any assumptions, limitations, or dependencies (e.g., specific solution hacks).\n\n2. Iterative Refinement:\n   - Continuously improve the cheatsheet by synthesizing both old and new solutions, refining explanations, and removing redundancies.\n   - Rather than deleting old content and writing new content each time, consider ways to maintain table content and synthesize information from multiple solutions.\n   - After solving a new problem, document any reusable strategies, edge cases, optimization techniques, or pseudocodes. \n\n3. Clarity and Usability:\n   - Write concise, actioanble, well-structured entries.\n   - Focus on key insights or strategies that make solutions correct and effective.\n\n4. Reusability:\n   - Provide clear solutions, meta strategies, and reasoning pseudocodes that are easily adaptable to different contexts.\n   - Avoid trivial content; focus on non-obvious, critical solution details and approaches.\n   - Make sure to add as many examples as you can in the cheatsheet. \n   - Any useful, efficient, generalizable, and illustrative solutions to the previous problems should be included in the cheatsheet.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Cheatsheet Structure\nThe cheatsheet can be divided into the following sections:\n\n1. Solutions, and Implementation Patterns:\n   - Document solution templates, and reusable reasoning pseudocodes.\n   - Include descriptions, annotated examples, and potential pitfalls, albeit succinctly.\n\n2. [OPTIONAL] Edge Cases and Validation Traps:\n   - Catalog scenarios that commonly cause errors or unexpected behavior.\n   - Provide checks, validations, or alternative approaches to handle them.\n\n3. General Meta-Reasoning Strategies:\n   - Describe high-level problem-solving frameworks and heuristics\n   - Provide concrete yet succinct step-by-step guides for tackling complex problems.\n\n4. Implement a Usage Counter\n   - Each entry must include a usage count: Increase the count every time a strategy is successfully used in problem-solving.\n   - Use the count to prioritize frequently used solutions over rarely applied ones.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Formatting Guidelines\nUse the following structure for each memory item:\n\n```\n<memory_item>\n<description>\n[Briefly describe the problem context, purpose, and key aspects of the solution.] (Refence: Q1, Q2, Q6, etc.)\n</description>\n<example>\n[Provide a worked-out solution, efficient strategy, or well-documented reasoning pseudocode.]\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count:  [Number of times this strategy has been used to solve a problem.]\n\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n[...]\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n```\n\n- Tagging: Use references like `(Q14)` or `(Q22)` to link entries to their originating contexts.\n- Grouping: Organize entries into logical sections and subsections.\n- Prioritizing: incorporate efficient algorithmic solutions, tricks, and strategies into the cheatsheet.\n- Diversity: Have as many useful and relevant memory items as possible to guide the model to tackle future questions.\n\nN.B. Keep in mind that once the cheatsheet is updated, any previous content not directly included will be lost and cannot be retrieved. Therefore, make sure to explicitly copy any (or all) relevant information from the previous cheatsheet to the new cheatsheet!!!\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Cheatsheet Template\nUse the following format for creating and updating the cheatsheet:\n\nNEW CHEATSHEET:\n```\n<cheatsheet>\n\nVersion: [Version Number]\n\nSOLUTIONS, AND IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS, AND PSEUDOCODES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n</cheatsheet>\n```\n\nN.B. Make sure that all information related to the cheatsheet is wrapped inside the <cheatsheet> block. The cheatsheet can be as long as circa 2000 words.\n\n-----\n-----\n\nYou are playing the game Twenty Questions. \n\nIn this game, there are 157 candidate words: Airplane, Apple, Banana, Baseball, Baseball bat, Basketball, Battery, Bear, Bed, Belt, Blender, Boat, Bookcase, Boots, Bowl, Bracelet, Broccoli, Brooch, Bus, Bush, Cactus, Calculator, Calendar, Camera, Cantaloupe, Canvas, Car, Carrot, Cat, Celery, Chair, Chopstick, Clarinet, Computer, Computer keyboard, Cooking pot, Corn, Couch, Cow, Cucumber, Cup, Desk, Diary, Dog, Doll, Dress, Dresser, Drill, Drum, Earring, Elephant, Eraser, Flute, Football, Forest, Fork, Gloves, Glue, Golf ball, Grape, Guitar, Hairclip, Hammer, Harp, Hat, Headphone, Helicopter, Helmet, Horse, Jacket, Key, Kite, Knife, Lake, Lawn mower, Lego, Lion, Locket, Mango, Marker, Mattress, Meteorite, Microwave, Monitor, Motorcycle, Mountain, Necklace, Nightstand, Ocean, Onion, Orange, Paintbrush, Painting, Pan, Pants, Paper, Peach, Peas, Pen, Pencil, Pendant, Piano, Pillow, Pineapple, Plate, Pliers, Potato, Printer, Puzzle, Rabbit, Rake, Refrigerator, Ring, River, Rock, Saw, Saxophone, Scarf, Scissors, Scooter, Screwdriver, Sculpture, Sea, Sharpie, Sheep, Ship, Shirt, Shoes, Shovel, Skirt, Smartphone, Soccer ball, Socks, Spinach, Spoon, Stapler, Strawberry, Table, Television, Tennis ball, Tennis racket, Tiger, Tomato, Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Train, Tree, Trombone, Truck, Trumpet, Violin, Volleyball, Watch, Watering can, Watermelon, Whisk, Wrench. \n\nOne of the 157 words is the answer word.

Purpose and Goals\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you are tasked with creating a continuously evolving reference designed to help solve a wide variety of tasks. The cheatsheet's purpose is to consolidate verified solutions, reusable strategies, and critical insights into a single, well-structured resource.\n\n- The cheatsheet should include quick, accurate, reliable, and practical solutions to a range of technical and creative challenges. \n- After seeing each case, you should improve the content of the cheatsheet, synthesizing lessons, insights, tricks, and errors learned from past problems and adapting to new challenges.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Core Responsibilities\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you should:\n   - Curate and preserve knolwedge: Select and document only the most relevant, most useful, and most actionable solutions and strategies, while preserving old content of the cheatsheet.\n   - Maintain accuracy: Ensure that all entries in the cheatsheet are accurate, clear, and well-contextualized. \n   - Refine and update content: Continuously update and improve the content of the cheatsheet by incorporating new insights and solutions, removing repetitions or trivial information, and adding efficient solutions.\n   - Ensure practicality and comprehensiveness: Provide critical and informative examples, as well as pseudocodes outlining steps to solve problems efficiently, and actionable guidelines. \n\nBefore updating the cheatsheet, however, you should first assess the correctness of the provided solution and strategically incorporate insights, solutions, and pseudocodes into the new cheatsheet. Always aim to preserve and keep correct, useful, and illustrative solutions and strategies for future cheatsheets.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Principles and Best Practices\n1. Accuracy and Relevance:\n   - Only include solutions and strategies that have been tested and proven effective.\n   - Clearly state any assumptions, limitations, or dependencies (e.g., specific solution hacks).\n\n2. Iterative Refinement:\n   - Continuously improve the cheatsheet by synthesizing both old and new solutions, refining explanations, and removing redundancies.\n   - Rather than deleting old content and writing new content each time, consider ways to maintain table content and synthesize information from multiple solutions.\n   - After solving a new problem, document any reusable strategies, edge cases, optimization techniques, or pseudocodes. \n\n3. Clarity and Usability:\n   - Write concise, actioanble, well-structured entries.\n   - Focus on key insights or strategies that make solutions correct and effective.\n\n4. Reusability:\n   - Provide clear solutions, meta strategies, and reasoning pseudocodes that are easily adaptable to different contexts.\n   - Avoid trivial content; focus on non-obvious, critical solution details and approaches.\n   - Make sure to add as many examples as you can in the cheatsheet. \n   - Any useful, efficient, generalizable, and illustrative solutions to the previous problems should be included in the cheatsheet.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Cheatsheet Structure\nThe cheatsheet can be divided into the following sections:\n\n1. Solutions, and Implementation Patterns:\n   - Document solution templates, and reusable reasoning pseudocodes.\n   - Include descriptions, annotated examples, and potential pitfalls, albeit succinctly.\n\n2. [OPTIONAL] Edge Cases and Validation Traps:\n   - Catalog scenarios that commonly cause errors or unexpected behavior.\n   - Provide checks, validations, or alternative approaches to handle them.\n\n3. General Meta-Reasoning Strategies:\n   - Describe high-level problem-solving frameworks and heuristics\n   - Provide concrete yet succinct step-by-step guides for tackling complex problems.\n\n4. Implement a Usage Counter\n   - Each entry must include a usage count: Increase the count every time a strategy is successfully used in problem-solving.\n   - Use the count to prioritize frequently used solutions over rarely applied ones.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Formatting Guidelines\nUse the following structure for each memory item:\n\n```\n<memory_item>\n<description>\n[Briefly describe the problem context, purpose, and key aspects of the solution.] (Refence: Q1, Q2, Q6, etc.)\n</description>\n<example>\n[Provide a worked-out solution, efficient strategy, or well-documented reasoning pseudocode.]\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count:  [Number of times this strategy has been used to solve a problem.]\n\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n[...]\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n```\n\n- Tagging: Use references like `(Q14)` or `(Q22)` to link entries to their originating contexts.\n- Grouping: Organize entries into logical sections and subsections.\n- Prioritizing: incorporate efficient algorithmic solutions, tricks, and strategies into the cheatsheet.\n- Diversity: Have as many useful and relevant memory items as possible to guide the model to tackle future questions.\n\nN.B. Keep in mind that once the cheatsheet is updated, any previous content not directly included will be lost and cannot be retrieved. Therefore, make sure to explicitly copy any (or all) relevant information from the previous cheatsheet to the new cheatsheet!!!\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Cheatsheet Template\nUse the following format for creating and updating the cheatsheet:\n\nNEW CHEATSHEET:\n```\n<cheatsheet>\n\nVersion: [Version Number]\n\nSOLUTIONS, AND IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS, AND PSEUDOCODES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n</cheatsheet>\n```\n\nN.B. Make sure that all information related to the cheatsheet is wrapped inside the <cheatsheet> block. The cheatsheet can be as long as circa 2000 words.\n\n-----\n-----\n\nYou are playing the game Twenty Questions. \n\nIn this game, there are 157 candidate words: Airplane, Apple, Banana, Baseball, Baseball bat, Basketball, Battery, Bear, Bed, Belt, Blender, Boat, Bookcase, Boots, Bowl, Bracelet, Broccoli, Brooch, Bus, Bush, Cactus, Calculator, Calendar, Camera, Cantaloupe, Canvas, Car, Carrot, Cat, Celery, Chair, Chopstick, Clarinet, Computer, Computer keyboard, Cooking pot, Corn, Couch, Cow, Cucumber, Cup, Desk, Diary, Dog, Doll, Dress, Dresser, Drill, Drum, Earring, Elephant, Eraser, Flute, Football, Forest, Fork, Gloves, Glue, Golf ball, Grape, Guitar, Hairclip, Hammer, Harp, Hat, Headphone, Helicopter, Helmet, Horse, Jacket, Key, Kite, Knife, Lake, Lawn mower, Lego, Lion, Locket, Mango, Marker, Mattress, Meteorite, Microwave, Monitor, Motorcycle, Mountain, Necklace, Nightstand, Ocean, Onion, Orange, Paintbrush, Painting, Pan, Pants, Paper, Peach, Peas, Pen, Pencil, Pendant, Piano, Pillow, Pineapple, Plate, Pliers, Potato, Printer, Puzzle, Rabbit, Rake, Refrigerator, Ring, River, Rock, Saw, Saxophone, Scarf, Scissors, Scooter, Screwdriver, Sculpture, Sea, Sharpie, Sheep, Ship, Shirt, Shoes, Shovel, Skirt, Smartphone, Soccer ball, Socks, Spinach, Spoon, Stapler, Strawberry, Table, Television, Tennis ball, Tennis racket, Tiger, Tomato, Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Train, Tree, Trombone, Truck, Trumpet, Violin, Volleyball, Watch, Watering can, Watermelon, Whisk, Wrench. \n\nOne of the 157 words is the answer word.

Purpose and Goals\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you are tasked with creating a continuously evolving reference designed to help solve a wide variety of tasks. The cheatsheet's purpose is to consolidate verified solutions, reusable strategies, and critical insights into a single, well-structured resource.\n\n- The cheatsheet should include quick, accurate, reliable, and practical solutions to a range of technical and creative challenges. \n- After seeing each case, you should improve the content of the cheatsheet, synthesizing lessons, insights, tricks, and errors learned from past problems and adapting to new challenges.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Core Responsibilities\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you should:\n   - Curate and preserve knolwedge: Select and document only the most relevant, most useful, and most actionable solutions and strategies, while preserving old content of the cheatsheet.\n   - Maintain accuracy: Ensure that all entries in the cheatsheet are accurate, clear, and well-contextualized. \n   - Refine and update content: Continuously update and improve the content of the cheatsheet by incorporating new insights and solutions, removing repetitions or trivial information, and adding efficient solutions.\n   - Ensure practicality and comprehensiveness: Provide critical and informative examples, as well as pseudocodes outlining steps to solve problems efficiently, and actionable guidelines. \n\nBefore updating the cheatsheet, however, you should first assess the correctness of the provided solution and strategically incorporate insights, solutions, and pseudocodes into the new cheatsheet. Always aim to preserve and keep correct, useful, and illustrative solutions and strategies for future cheatsheets.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Principles and Best Practices\n1. Accuracy and Relevance:\n   - Only include solutions and strategies that have been tested and proven effective.\n   - Clearly state any assumptions, limitations, or dependencies (e.g., specific solution hacks).\n\n2. Iterative Refinement:\n   - Continuously improve the cheatsheet by synthesizing both old and new solutions, refining explanations, and removing redundancies.\n   - Rather than deleting old content and writing new content each time, consider ways to maintain table content and synthesize information from multiple solutions.\n   - After solving a new problem, document any reusable strategies, edge cases, optimization techniques, or pseudocodes. \n\n3. Clarity and Usability:\n   - Write concise, actioanble, well-structured entries.\n   - Focus on key insights or strategies that make solutions correct and effective.\n\n4. Reusability:\n   - Provide clear solutions, meta strategies, and reasoning pseudocodes that are easily adaptable to different contexts.\n   - Avoid trivial content; focus on non-obvious, critical solution details and approaches.\n   - Make sure to add as many examples as you can in the cheatsheet. \n   - Any useful, efficient, generalizable, and illustrative solutions to the previous problems should be included in the cheatsheet.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Cheatsheet Structure\nThe cheatsheet can be divided into the following sections:\n\n1. Solutions, and Implementation Patterns:\n   - Document solution templates, and reusable reasoning pseudocodes.\n   - Include descriptions, annotated examples, and potential pitfalls, albeit succinctly.\n\n2. [OPTIONAL] Edge Cases and Validation Traps:\n   - Catalog scenarios that commonly cause errors or unexpected behavior.\n   - Provide checks, validations, or alternative approaches to handle them.\n\n3. General Meta-Reasoning Strategies:\n   - Describe high-level problem-solving frameworks and heuristics\n   - Provide concrete yet succinct step-by-step guides for tackling complex problems.\n\n4. Implement a Usage Counter\n   - Each entry must include a usage count: Increase the count every time a strategy is successfully used in problem-solving.\n   - Use the count to prioritize frequently used solutions over rarely applied ones.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Formatting Guidelines\nUse the following structure for each memory item:\n\n```\n<memory_item>\n<description>\n[Briefly describe the problem context, purpose, and key aspects of the solution.] (Refence: Q1, Q2, Q6, etc.)\n</description>\n<example>\n[Provide a worked-out solution, efficient strategy, or well-documented reasoning pseudocode.]\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count:  [Number of times this strategy has been used to solve a problem.]\n\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n[...]\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n```\n\n- Tagging: Use references like `(Q14)` or `(Q22)` to link entries to their originating contexts.\n- Grouping: Organize entries into logical sections and subsections.\n- Prioritizing: incorporate efficient algorithmic solutions, tricks, and strategies into the cheatsheet.\n- Diversity: Have as many useful and relevant memory items as possible to guide the model to tackle future questions.\n\nN.B. Keep in mind that once the cheatsheet is updated, any previous content not directly included will be lost and cannot be retrieved. Therefore, make sure to explicitly copy any (or all) relevant information from the previous cheatsheet to the new cheatsheet!!!\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Cheatsheet Template\nUse the following format for creating and updating the cheatsheet:\n\nNEW CHEATSHEET:\n```\n<cheatsheet>\n\nVersion: [Version Number]\n\nSOLUTIONS, AND IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS, AND PSEUDOCODES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n</cheatsheet>\n```\n\nN.B.

Start with the full list of candidate words.\n2. Ask a question that splits the list into two roughly equal groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n3. Based on the response, eliminate the irrelevant group.\n4. Repeat the process, narrowing down the pool with each question by targeting specific subcategories (e.g., \"Is the answer word related to transportation?\").\n5. Continue until the pool is small enough to identify the answer word directly.\n</example>\n** Count: 14\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nSpecific Trait Identification: Focus on unique or defining traits of the remaining candidates to pinpoint the answer word. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6, Game #7, Game #8, Game #9, Game #10, Game #11, Game #12, Game #13, Game #14)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Once the pool is small (e.g., 5-10 candidates), identify unique traits of each remaining candidate.\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is the answer word powered by an engine?\").\n3. Use the responses to eliminate all candidates except the one that matches the traits.\n</example>\n** Count: 14\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nHierarchical Questioning for Plants and Fruits: When the answer word is related to plants or fruits, use a hierarchical approach to narrow down categories (e.g., plant type, fruit type, region, color, size, etc.). (Reference: Game #14)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Ask if the answer word is a living thing.\n2. Narrow down by type (e.g., \"Is the answer word a plant?\" \u2192 \"Is the answer word a fruit?\").\n3. For fruits, ask about regional growth (e.g., \"Is it tropical?\" \u2192 \"Is it commonly grown in temperate regions?\").\n4. Further filter by physical traits (e.g., \"Is it small in size?\" \u2192 \"Does it grow on a tree?\" \u2192 \"Does it have a fuzzy skin?\").\n5. Use these filters to systematically eliminate candidates until the answer word is identified.\n</example>\n** Count: 1\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nExhaustive Elimination: When the pool is small but the answer is unclear, systematically eliminate all remaining candidates by asking direct questions about their defining traits.

Identify the remaining candidates in the pool.\n2. For each candidate, ask a direct question about a defining trait (e.g., \"Is the answer word a peach?\" or \"Is the answer word a mango?\").\n3. Continue until only one candidate remains.\n4. Avoid skipping over candidates or assuming traits without confirmation.\n</example>\n** Count: 10\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAvoiding Over-Narrowing: Avoid prematurely narrowing down the pool to a single category without sufficient evidence.

Avoid wasting questions on ambiguous phrasing. (Reference: Game #14)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. If a question receives an invalid response, analyze the phrasing to identify potential ambiguity (e.g., \"Is the answer word red in color?\" may be unclear due to subjective interpretation).\n2. Reframe the question with more precise language (e.g., \"Is the answer word typically red in color when ripe?\").\n3.

Purpose and Goals\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you are tasked with creating a continuously evolving reference designed to help solve a wide variety of tasks. The cheatsheet's purpose is to consolidate verified solutions, reusable strategies, and critical insights into a single, well-structured resource.\n\n- The cheatsheet should include quick, accurate, reliable, and practical solutions to a range of technical and creative challenges. \n- After seeing each case, you should improve the content of the cheatsheet, synthesizing lessons, insights, tricks, and errors learned from past problems and adapting to new challenges.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Core Responsibilities\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you should:\n   - Curate and preserve knolwedge: Select and document only the most relevant, most useful, and most actionable solutions and strategies, while preserving old content of the cheatsheet.\n   - Maintain accuracy: Ensure that all entries in the cheatsheet are accurate, clear, and well-contextualized. \n   - Refine and update content: Continuously update and improve the content of the cheatsheet by incorporating new insights and solutions, removing repetitions or trivial information, and adding efficient solutions.\n   - Ensure practicality and comprehensiveness: Provide critical and informative examples, as well as pseudocodes outlining steps to solve problems efficiently, and actionable guidelines. \n\nBefore updating the cheatsheet, however, you should first assess the correctness of the provided solution and strategically incorporate insights, solutions, and pseudocodes into the new cheatsheet. Always aim to preserve and keep correct, useful, and illustrative solutions and strategies for future cheatsheets.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Principles and Best Practices\n1. Accuracy and Relevance:\n   - Only include solutions and strategies that have been tested and proven effective.\n   - Clearly state any assumptions, limitations, or dependencies (e.g., specific solution hacks).\n\n2. Iterative Refinement:\n   - Continuously improve the cheatsheet by synthesizing both old and new solutions, refining explanations, and removing redundancies.\n   - Rather than deleting old content and writing new content each time, consider ways to maintain table content and synthesize information from multiple solutions.\n   - After solving a new problem, document any reusable strategies, edge cases, optimization techniques, or pseudocodes. \n\n3. Clarity and Usability:\n   - Write concise, actioanble, well-structured entries.\n   - Focus on key insights or strategies that make solutions correct and effective.\n\n4. Reusability:\n   - Provide clear solutions, meta strategies, and reasoning pseudocodes that are easily adaptable to different contexts.\n   - Avoid trivial content; focus on non-obvious, critical solution details and approaches.\n   - Make sure to add as many examples as you can in the cheatsheet. \n   - Any useful, efficient, generalizable, and illustrative solutions to the previous problems should be included in the cheatsheet.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Cheatsheet Structure\nThe cheatsheet can be divided into the following sections:\n\n1. Solutions, and Implementation Patterns:\n   - Document solution templates, and reusable reasoning pseudocodes.\n   - Include descriptions, annotated examples, and potential pitfalls, albeit succinctly.\n\n2. [OPTIONAL] Edge Cases and Validation Traps:\n   - Catalog scenarios that commonly cause errors or unexpected behavior.\n   - Provide checks, validations, or alternative approaches to handle them.\n\n3. General Meta-Reasoning Strategies:\n   - Describe high-level problem-solving frameworks and heuristics\n   - Provide concrete yet succinct step-by-step guides for tackling complex problems.\n\n4. Implement a Usage Counter\n   - Each entry must include a usage count: Increase the count every time a strategy is successfully used in problem-solving.\n   - Use the count to prioritize frequently used solutions over rarely applied ones.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Formatting Guidelines\nUse the following structure for each memory item:\n\n```\n<memory_item>\n<description>\n[Briefly describe the problem context, purpose, and key aspects of the solution.] (Refence: Q1, Q2, Q6, etc.)\n</description>\n<example>\n[Provide a worked-out solution, efficient strategy, or well-documented reasoning pseudocode.]\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count:  [Number of times this strategy has been used to solve a problem.]\n\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n[...]\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n```\n\n- Tagging: Use references like `(Q14)` or `(Q22)` to link entries to their originating contexts.\n- Grouping: Organize entries into logical sections and subsections.\n- Prioritizing: incorporate efficient algorithmic solutions, tricks, and strategies into the cheatsheet.\n- Diversity: Have as many useful and relevant memory items as possible to guide the model to tackle future questions.\n\nN.B. Keep in mind that once the cheatsheet is updated, any previous content not directly included will be lost and cannot be retrieved. Therefore, make sure to explicitly copy any (or all) relevant information from the previous cheatsheet to the new cheatsheet!!!\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Cheatsheet Template\nUse the following format for creating and updating the cheatsheet:\n\nNEW CHEATSHEET:\n```\n<cheatsheet>\n\nVersion: [Version Number]\n\nSOLUTIONS, AND IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS, AND PSEUDOCODES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n</cheatsheet>\n```\n\nN.B.

Purpose and Goals\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you are tasked with creating a continuously evolving reference designed to help solve a wide variety of tasks. The cheatsheet's purpose is to consolidate verified solutions, reusable strategies, and critical insights into a single, well-structured resource.\n\n- The cheatsheet should include quick, accurate, reliable, and practical solutions to a range of technical and creative challenges. \n- After seeing each case, you should improve the content of the cheatsheet, synthesizing lessons, insights, tricks, and errors learned from past problems and adapting to new challenges.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Core Responsibilities\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you should:\n   - Curate and preserve knolwedge: Select and document only the most relevant, most useful, and most actionable solutions and strategies, while preserving old content of the cheatsheet.\n   - Maintain accuracy: Ensure that all entries in the cheatsheet are accurate, clear, and well-contextualized. \n   - Refine and update content: Continuously update and improve the content of the cheatsheet by incorporating new insights and solutions, removing repetitions or trivial information, and adding efficient solutions.\n   - Ensure practicality and comprehensiveness: Provide critical and informative examples, as well as pseudocodes outlining steps to solve problems efficiently, and actionable guidelines. \n\nBefore updating the cheatsheet, however, you should first assess the correctness of the provided solution and strategically incorporate insights, solutions, and pseudocodes into the new cheatsheet. Always aim to preserve and keep correct, useful, and illustrative solutions and strategies for future cheatsheets.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Principles and Best Practices\n1. Accuracy and Relevance:\n   - Only include solutions and strategies that have been tested and proven effective.\n   - Clearly state any assumptions, limitations, or dependencies (e.g., specific solution hacks).\n\n2. Iterative Refinement:\n   - Continuously improve the cheatsheet by synthesizing both old and new solutions, refining explanations, and removing redundancies.\n   - Rather than deleting old content and writing new content each time, consider ways to maintain table content and synthesize information from multiple solutions.\n   - After solving a new problem, document any reusable strategies, edge cases, optimization techniques, or pseudocodes. \n\n3. Clarity and Usability:\n   - Write concise, actioanble, well-structured entries.\n   - Focus on key insights or strategies that make solutions correct and effective.\n\n4. Reusability:\n   - Provide clear solutions, meta strategies, and reasoning pseudocodes that are easily adaptable to different contexts.\n   - Avoid trivial content; focus on non-obvious, critical solution details and approaches.\n   - Make sure to add as many examples as you can in the cheatsheet. \n   - Any useful, efficient, generalizable, and illustrative solutions to the previous problems should be included in the cheatsheet.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Cheatsheet Structure\nThe cheatsheet can be divided into the following sections:\n\n1. Solutions, and Implementation Patterns:\n   - Document solution templates, and reusable reasoning pseudocodes.\n   - Include descriptions, annotated examples, and potential pitfalls, albeit succinctly.\n\n2. [OPTIONAL] Edge Cases and Validation Traps:\n   - Catalog scenarios that commonly cause errors or unexpected behavior.\n   - Provide checks, validations, or alternative approaches to handle them.\n\n3. General Meta-Reasoning Strategies:\n   - Describe high-level problem-solving frameworks and heuristics\n   - Provide concrete yet succinct step-by-step guides for tackling complex problems.\n\n4. Implement a Usage Counter\n   - Each entry must include a usage count: Increase the count every time a strategy is successfully used in problem-solving.\n   - Use the count to prioritize frequently used solutions over rarely applied ones.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Formatting Guidelines\nUse the following structure for each memory item:\n\n```\n<memory_item>\n<description>\n[Briefly describe the problem context, purpose, and key aspects of the solution.] (Refence: Q1, Q2, Q6, etc.)\n</description>\n<example>\n[Provide a worked-out solution, efficient strategy, or well-documented reasoning pseudocode.]\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count:  [Number of times this strategy has been used to solve a problem.]\n\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n[...]\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n```\n\n- Tagging: Use references like `(Q14)` or `(Q22)` to link entries to their originating contexts.\n- Grouping: Organize entries into logical sections and subsections.\n- Prioritizing: incorporate efficient algorithmic solutions, tricks, and strategies into the cheatsheet.\n- Diversity: Have as many useful and relevant memory items as possible to guide the model to tackle future questions.\n\nN.B. Keep in mind that once the cheatsheet is updated, any previous content not directly included will be lost and cannot be retrieved. Therefore, make sure to explicitly copy any (or all) relevant information from the previous cheatsheet to the new cheatsheet!!!\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Cheatsheet Template\nUse the following format for creating and updating the cheatsheet:\n\nNEW CHEATSHEET:\n```\n<cheatsheet>\n\nVersion: [Version Number]\n\nSOLUTIONS, AND IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS, AND PSEUDOCODES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n</cheatsheet>\n```\n\nN.B.

Once the pool is small (e.g., 5-10 candidates), identify unique traits of each remaining candidate.\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is the answer word powered by an engine?\").\n3. Use the responses to eliminate all candidates except the one that matches the traits.\n</example>\n** Count: 16\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nHierarchical Questioning for Sports Equipment: When the answer word is related to sports or games, use a hierarchical approach to narrow down categories (e.g., equipment, type of sport, specific usage). (Reference: Game #16)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Ask if the answer word is related to sports or games.\n2. Narrow down by type (e.g., \"Is it a type of equipment used in sports or games?\" \u2192 \"Is it a ball?\").\n3. For balls, ask about the sport it is used in (e.g., \"Is it used in a sport played with hands?\" \u2192 \"Is it used in soccer?\").\n4.

Purpose and Goals\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you are tasked with creating a continuously evolving reference designed to help solve a wide variety of tasks. The cheatsheet's purpose is to consolidate verified solutions, reusable strategies, and critical insights into a single, well-structured resource.\n\n- The cheatsheet should include quick, accurate, reliable, and practical solutions to a range of technical and creative challenges. \n- After seeing each case, you should improve the content of the cheatsheet, synthesizing lessons, insights, tricks, and errors learned from past problems and adapting to new challenges.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Core Responsibilities\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you should:\n   - Curate and preserve knolwedge: Select and document only the most relevant, most useful, and most actionable solutions and strategies, while preserving old content of the cheatsheet.\n   - Maintain accuracy: Ensure that all entries in the cheatsheet are accurate, clear, and well-contextualized. \n   - Refine and update content: Continuously update and improve the content of the cheatsheet by incorporating new insights and solutions, removing repetitions or trivial information, and adding efficient solutions.\n   - Ensure practicality and comprehensiveness: Provide critical and informative examples, as well as pseudocodes outlining steps to solve problems efficiently, and actionable guidelines. \n\nBefore updating the cheatsheet, however, you should first assess the correctness of the provided solution and strategically incorporate insights, solutions, and pseudocodes into the new cheatsheet. Always aim to preserve and keep correct, useful, and illustrative solutions and strategies for future cheatsheets.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Principles and Best Practices\n1. Accuracy and Relevance:\n   - Only include solutions and strategies that have been tested and proven effective.\n   - Clearly state any assumptions, limitations, or dependencies (e.g., specific solution hacks).\n\n2. Iterative Refinement:\n   - Continuously improve the cheatsheet by synthesizing both old and new solutions, refining explanations, and removing redundancies.\n   - Rather than deleting old content and writing new content each time, consider ways to maintain table content and synthesize information from multiple solutions.\n   - After solving a new problem, document any reusable strategies, edge cases, optimization techniques, or pseudocodes. \n\n3. Clarity and Usability:\n   - Write concise, actioanble, well-structured entries.\n   - Focus on key insights or strategies that make solutions correct and effective.\n\n4. Reusability:\n   - Provide clear solutions, meta strategies, and reasoning pseudocodes that are easily adaptable to different contexts.\n   - Avoid trivial content; focus on non-obvious, critical solution details and approaches.\n   - Make sure to add as many examples as you can in the cheatsheet. \n   - Any useful, efficient, generalizable, and illustrative solutions to the previous problems should be included in the cheatsheet.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Cheatsheet Structure\nThe cheatsheet can be divided into the following sections:\n\n1. Solutions, and Implementation Patterns:\n   - Document solution templates, and reusable reasoning pseudocodes.\n   - Include descriptions, annotated examples, and potential pitfalls, albeit succinctly.\n\n2. [OPTIONAL] Edge Cases and Validation Traps:\n   - Catalog scenarios that commonly cause errors or unexpected behavior.\n   - Provide checks, validations, or alternative approaches to handle them.\n\n3. General Meta-Reasoning Strategies:\n   - Describe high-level problem-solving frameworks and heuristics\n   - Provide concrete yet succinct step-by-step guides for tackling complex problems.\n\n4. Implement a Usage Counter\n   - Each entry must include a usage count: Increase the count every time a strategy is successfully used in problem-solving.\n   - Use the count to prioritize frequently used solutions over rarely applied ones.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Formatting Guidelines\nUse the following structure for each memory item:\n\n```\n<memory_item>\n<description>\n[Briefly describe the problem context, purpose, and key aspects of the solution.] (Refence: Q1, Q2, Q6, etc.)\n</description>\n<example>\n[Provide a worked-out solution, efficient strategy, or well-documented reasoning pseudocode.]\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count:  [Number of times this strategy has been used to solve a problem.]\n\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n[...]\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n```\n\n- Tagging: Use references like `(Q14)` or `(Q22)` to link entries to their originating contexts.\n- Grouping: Organize entries into logical sections and subsections.\n- Prioritizing: incorporate efficient algorithmic solutions, tricks, and strategies into the cheatsheet.\n- Diversity: Have as many useful and relevant memory items as possible to guide the model to tackle future questions.\n\nN.B. Keep in mind that once the cheatsheet is updated, any previous content not directly included will be lost and cannot be retrieved. Therefore, make sure to explicitly copy any (or all) relevant information from the previous cheatsheet to the new cheatsheet!!!\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Cheatsheet Template\nUse the following format for creating and updating the cheatsheet:\n\nNEW CHEATSHEET:\n```\n<cheatsheet>\n\nVersion: [Version Number]\n\nSOLUTIONS, AND IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS, AND PSEUDOCODES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n</cheatsheet>\n```\n\nN.B. Make sure that all information related to the cheatsheet is wrapped inside the <cheatsheet> block.

Analyze the candidate pool and identify the largest logical group.\n2. Formulate a question that targets this group (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\" eliminates all non-living things if the answer is No).\n3.

Purpose and Goals\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you are tasked with creating a continuously evolving reference designed to help solve a wide variety of tasks. The cheatsheet's purpose is to consolidate verified solutions, reusable strategies, and critical insights into a single, well-structured resource.\n\n- The cheatsheet should include quick, accurate, reliable, and practical solutions to a range of technical and creative challenges. \n- After seeing each case, you should improve the content of the cheatsheet, synthesizing lessons, insights, tricks, and errors learned from past problems and adapting to new challenges.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Core Responsibilities\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you should:\n   - Curate and preserve knolwedge: Select and document only the most relevant, most useful, and most actionable solutions and strategies, while preserving old content of the cheatsheet.\n   - Maintain accuracy: Ensure that all entries in the cheatsheet are accurate, clear, and well-contextualized. \n   - Refine and update content: Continuously update and improve the content of the cheatsheet by incorporating new insights and solutions, removing repetitions or trivial information, and adding efficient solutions.\n   - Ensure practicality and comprehensiveness: Provide critical and informative examples, as well as pseudocodes outlining steps to solve problems efficiently, and actionable guidelines. \n\nBefore updating the cheatsheet, however, you should first assess the correctness of the provided solution and strategically incorporate insights, solutions, and pseudocodes into the new cheatsheet. Always aim to preserve and keep correct, useful, and illustrative solutions and strategies for future cheatsheets.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Principles and Best Practices\n1. Accuracy and Relevance:\n   - Only include solutions and strategies that have been tested and proven effective.\n   - Clearly state any assumptions, limitations, or dependencies (e.g., specific solution hacks).\n\n2. Iterative Refinement:\n   - Continuously improve the cheatsheet by synthesizing both old and new solutions, refining explanations, and removing redundancies.\n   - Rather than deleting old content and writing new content each time, consider ways to maintain table content and synthesize information from multiple solutions.\n   - After solving a new problem, document any reusable strategies, edge cases, optimization techniques, or pseudocodes. \n\n3. Clarity and Usability:\n   - Write concise, actioanble, well-structured entries.\n   - Focus on key insights or strategies that make solutions correct and effective.\n\n4. Reusability:\n   - Provide clear solutions, meta strategies, and reasoning pseudocodes that are easily adaptable to different contexts.\n   - Avoid trivial content; focus on non-obvious, critical solution details and approaches.\n   - Make sure to add as many examples as you can in the cheatsheet. \n   - Any useful, efficient, generalizable, and illustrative solutions to the previous problems should be included in the cheatsheet.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Cheatsheet Structure\nThe cheatsheet can be divided into the following sections:\n\n1. Solutions, and Implementation Patterns:\n   - Document solution templates, and reusable reasoning pseudocodes.\n   - Include descriptions, annotated examples, and potential pitfalls, albeit succinctly.\n\n2. [OPTIONAL] Edge Cases and Validation Traps:\n   - Catalog scenarios that commonly cause errors or unexpected behavior.\n   - Provide checks, validations, or alternative approaches to handle them.\n\n3. General Meta-Reasoning Strategies:\n   - Describe high-level problem-solving frameworks and heuristics\n   - Provide concrete yet succinct step-by-step guides for tackling complex problems.\n\n4. Implement a Usage Counter\n   - Each entry must include a usage count: Increase the count every time a strategy is successfully used in problem-solving.\n   - Use the count to prioritize frequently used solutions over rarely applied ones.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Formatting Guidelines\nUse the following structure for each memory item:\n\n```\n<memory_item>\n<description>\n[Briefly describe the problem context, purpose, and key aspects of the solution.] (Refence: Q1, Q2, Q6, etc.)\n</description>\n<example>\n[Provide a worked-out solution, efficient strategy, or well-documented reasoning pseudocode.]\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count:  [Number of times this strategy has been used to solve a problem.]\n\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n[...]\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n```\n\n- Tagging: Use references like `(Q14)` or `(Q22)` to link entries to their originating contexts.\n- Grouping: Organize entries into logical sections and subsections.\n- Prioritizing: incorporate efficient algorithmic solutions, tricks, and strategies into the cheatsheet.\n- Diversity: Have as many useful and relevant memory items as possible to guide the model to tackle future questions.\n\nN.B. Keep in mind that once the cheatsheet is updated, any previous content not directly included will be lost and cannot be retrieved. Therefore, make sure to explicitly copy any (or all) relevant information from the previous cheatsheet to the new cheatsheet!!!\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Cheatsheet Template\nUse the following format for creating and updating the cheatsheet:\n\nNEW CHEATSHEET:\n```\n<cheatsheet>\n\nVersion: [Version Number]\n\nSOLUTIONS, AND IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS, AND PSEUDOCODES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n</cheatsheet>\n```\n\nN.B.

This strategy works best when the candidate pool is large and diverse. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6, Game #7, Game #8, Game #9, Game #10, Game #11, Game #12, Game #13, Game #14, Game #15, Game #16, Game #17, Game #18)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Start with the full list of candidate words.\n2. Ask a question that splits the list into two roughly equal groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n3. Based on the response, eliminate the irrelevant group.\n4. Repeat the process, narrowing down the pool with each question by targeting specific subcategories (e.g., \"Is the answer word related to transportation?\").\n5. Continue until the pool is small enough to identify the answer word directly.\n</example>\n** Count: 18\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nSpecific Trait Identification: Focus on unique or defining traits of the remaining candidates to pinpoint the answer word. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6, Game #7, Game #8, Game #9, Game #10, Game #11, Game #12, Game #13, Game #14, Game #15, Game #16, Game #17, Game #18)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Once the pool is small (e.g., 5-10 candidates), identify unique traits of each remaining candidate.\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is the answer word powered by an engine?\").\n3. Use the responses to eliminate all candidates except the one that matches the traits.\n</example>\n** Count: 18\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nHierarchical Questioning for Kitchenware: When the answer word is related to kitchenware, use a hierarchical approach to narrow down categories (e.g., type of item, specific usage, function). (Reference: Game #18)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Ask if the answer word is related to kitchenware.\n2. Narrow down by type (e.g., \"Is it a utensil?\" \u2192 \"Is it used for eating or serving food?\").\n3. For utensils, ask about the specific function (e.g., \"Is it used for cutting or slicing food?\" \u2192 \"Is it a knife?\").\n4. Use these filters to systematically eliminate candidates until the answer word is identified.\n</example>\n** Count: 1\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nExhaustive Elimination: When the pool is small but the answer is unclear, systematically eliminate all remaining candidates by asking direct questions about their defining traits.

Identify the remaining candidates in the pool.\n2. For each candidate, ask a direct question about a defining trait (e.g., \"Is the answer word a peach?\" or \"Is the answer word a mango?\").\n3. Continue until only one candidate remains.\n4. Avoid skipping over candidates or assuming traits without confirmation.\n</example>\n** Count: 10\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAvoiding Over-Narrowing: Avoid prematurely narrowing down the pool to a single category without sufficient evidence. Keep options open until enough traits are confirmed. (Reference: Game #2, Game #3, Game #5, Game #7, Game #8, Game #10, Game #11, Game #12, Game #14)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Avoid assuming the answer word belongs to a specific subcategory too early (e.g., assuming \"peach\" without confirming other possibilities like \"apple\").\n2. Ask broader questions to confirm the category (e.g., \"Is it a fruit?\" \u2192 \"Does it grow on a tree?\").\n3. Only narrow down to a single candidate when sufficient evidence has been gathered.\n</example>\n** Count: 9\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nHandling Invalid Responses: When encountering invalid responses, reframe the question to ensure clarity and alignment with the game's rules. Avoid wasting questions on ambiguous phrasing. (Reference: Game #14)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. If a question receives an invalid response, analyze the phrasing to identify potential ambiguity (e.g., \"Is the answer word red in color?\" may be unclear due to subjective interpretation).\n2. Reframe the question with more precise language (e.g., \"Is the answer word typically red in color when ripe?\").\n3. Avoid repeating invalid questions and instead focus on alternative traits to narrow down the pool.\n</example>\n** Count: 1\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nHierarchical Questioning Framework: Structure questions in a hierarchical manner, starting with broad categories and progressively narrowing down to specific traits.

Analyze the candidate pool and identify the largest logical group.\n2. Formulate a question that targets this group (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\" eliminates all non-living things if the answer is No).\n3. Repeat the process, ensuring each question eliminates a significant portion of the remaining pool.\n4. Transition to specific questions only when the pool is sufficiently small.\n</example>\n** Count: 18\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nTrait-Based Elimination: Use questions targeting specific traits to eliminate candidates systematically.

Start with the full list of candidate words.\n2. Ask a question that splits the list into two roughly equal groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n3. Based on the response, eliminate the irrelevant group.\n4. Repeat the process, narrowing down the pool with each question by targeting specific subcategories (e.g., \"Is the answer word related to transportation?\").\n5. Continue until the pool is small enough to identify the answer word directly.\n</example>\n** Count: 18\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nSpecific Trait Identification: Focus on unique or defining traits of the remaining candidates to pinpoint the answer word. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6, Game #7, Game #8, Game #9, Game #10, Game #11, Game #12, Game #13, Game #14, Game #15, Game #16, Game #17, Game #18)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Once the pool is small (e.g., 5-10 candidates), identify unique traits of each remaining candidate.\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is the answer word powered by an engine?\").\n3. Use the responses to eliminate all candidates except the one that matches the traits.\n</example>\n** Count: 18\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nHierarchical Questioning for Kitchenware: When the answer word is related to kitchenware, use a hierarchical approach to narrow down categories (e.g., type of item, specific usage, function). (Reference: Game #18)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Ask if the answer word is related to kitchenware.\n2. Narrow down by type (e.g., \"Is it a utensil?\" \u2192 \"Is it used for eating or serving food?\").\n3. For utensils, ask about the specific function (e.g., \"Is it used for cutting or slicing food?\" \u2192 \"Is it a knife?\").\n4. Use these filters to systematically eliminate candidates until the answer word is identified.\n</example>\n** Count: 1\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nExhaustive Elimination: When the pool is small but the answer is unclear, systematically eliminate all remaining candidates by asking direct questions about their defining traits.

Identify the remaining candidates in the pool.\n2. For each candidate, ask a direct question about a defining trait (e.g., \"Is the answer word a peach?\" or \"Is the answer word a mango?\").\n3. Continue until only one candidate remains.\n4. Avoid skipping over candidates or assuming traits without confirmation.\n</example>\n** Count: 10\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAvoiding Over-Narrowing: Avoid prematurely narrowing down the pool to a single category without sufficient evidence.

Avoid assuming the answer word belongs to a specific subcategory too early (e.g., assuming \"peach\" without confirming other possibilities like \"apple\").\n2. Ask broader questions to confirm the category (e.g., \"Is it a fruit?\" \u2192 \"Does it grow on a tree?\").\n3. Only narrow down to a single candidate when sufficient evidence has been gathered.\n</example>\n** Count: 9\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nHandling Invalid Responses: When encountering invalid responses, reframe the question to ensure clarity and alignment with the game's rules. Avoid wasting questions on ambiguous phrasing. (Reference: Game #14)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. If a question receives an invalid response, analyze the phrasing to identify potential ambiguity (e.g., \"Is the answer word red in color?\" may be unclear due to subjective interpretation).\n2. Reframe the question with more precise language (e.g., \"Is the answer word typically red in color when ripe?\").\n3. Avoid repeating invalid questions and instead focus on alternative traits to narrow down the pool.\n</example>\n** Count: 1\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nHierarchical Questioning Framework: Structure questions in a hierarchical manner, starting with broad categories and progressively narrowing down to specific traits.

Begin with a broad question that splits the candidate pool into two large groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n2. Follow up with questions that progressively narrow down the pool (e.g., \"Is the answer word a plant?\" \u2192 \"Is it a fruit?\" \u2192 \"Does it grow on a tree?\").\n3. Once the pool is small, switch to specific trait-based questions to identify the answer word directly.\n</example>\n** Count: 18\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nEfficiency Maximization: Aim to eliminate the largest possible group of candidates with each question.

Analyze the candidate pool and identify the largest logical group.\n2. Formulate a question that targets this group (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\" eliminates all non-living things if the answer is No).\n3. Repeat the process, ensuring each question eliminates a significant portion of the remaining pool.\n4. Transition to specific questions only when the pool is sufficiently small.\n</example>\n** Count: 18\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nTrait-Based Elimination: Use questions targeting specific traits to eliminate candidates systematically.

The cheatsheet's purpose is to consolidate verified solutions, reusable strategies, and critical insights into a single, well-structured resource.\n\n- The cheatsheet should include quick, accurate, reliable, and practical solutions to a range of technical and creative challenges. \n- After seeing each case, you should improve the content of the cheatsheet, synthesizing lessons, insights, tricks, and errors learned from past problems and adapting to new challenges.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Core Responsibilities\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you should:\n   - Curate and preserve knolwedge: Select and document only the most relevant, most useful, and most actionable solutions and strategies, while preserving old content of the cheatsheet.\n   - Maintain accuracy: Ensure that all entries in the cheatsheet are accurate, clear, and well-contextualized. \n   - Refine and update content: Continuously update and improve the content of the cheatsheet by incorporating new insights and solutions, removing repetitions or trivial information, and adding efficient solutions.\n   - Ensure practicality and comprehensiveness: Provide critical and informative examples, as well as pseudocodes outlining steps to solve problems efficiently, and actionable guidelines. \n\nBefore updating the cheatsheet, however, you should first assess the correctness of the provided solution and strategically incorporate insights, solutions, and pseudocodes into the new cheatsheet. Always aim to preserve and keep correct, useful, and illustrative solutions and strategies for future cheatsheets.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Principles and Best Practices\n1. Accuracy and Relevance:\n   - Only include solutions and strategies that have been tested and proven effective.\n   - Clearly state any assumptions, limitations, or dependencies (e.g., specific solution hacks).\n\n2. Iterative Refinement:\n   - Continuously improve the cheatsheet by synthesizing both old and new solutions, refining explanations, and removing redundancies.\n   - Rather than deleting old content and writing new content each time, consider ways to maintain table content and synthesize information from multiple solutions.\n   - After solving a new problem, document any reusable strategies, edge cases, optimization techniques, or pseudocodes. \n\n3. Clarity and Usability:\n   - Write concise, actioanble, well-structured entries.\n   - Focus on key insights or strategies that make solutions correct and effective.\n\n4. Reusability:\n   - Provide clear solutions, meta strategies, and reasoning pseudocodes that are easily adaptable to different contexts.\n   - Avoid trivial content; focus on non-obvious, critical solution details and approaches.\n   - Make sure to add as many examples as you can in the cheatsheet. \n   - Any useful, efficient, generalizable, and illustrative solutions to the previous problems should be included in the cheatsheet.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Cheatsheet Structure\nThe cheatsheet can be divided into the following sections:\n\n1. Solutions, and Implementation Patterns:\n   - Document solution templates, and reusable reasoning pseudocodes.\n   - Include descriptions, annotated examples, and potential pitfalls, albeit succinctly.\n\n2. [OPTIONAL] Edge Cases and Validation Traps:\n   - Catalog scenarios that commonly cause errors or unexpected behavior.\n   - Provide checks, validations, or alternative approaches to handle them.\n\n3. General Meta-Reasoning Strategies:\n   - Describe high-level problem-solving frameworks and heuristics\n   - Provide concrete yet succinct step-by-step guides for tackling complex problems.\n\n4. Implement a Usage Counter\n   - Each entry must include a usage count: Increase the count every time a strategy is successfully used in problem-solving.\n   - Use the count to prioritize frequently used solutions over rarely applied ones.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Formatting Guidelines\nUse the following structure for each memory item:\n\n```\n<memory_item>\n<description>\n[Briefly describe the problem context, purpose, and key aspects of the solution.] (Refence: Q1, Q2, Q6, etc.)\n</description>\n<example>\n[Provide a worked-out solution, efficient strategy, or well-documented reasoning pseudocode.]\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count:  [Number of times this strategy has been used to solve a problem.]\n\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n[...]\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n```\n\n- Tagging: Use references like `(Q14)` or `(Q22)` to link entries to their originating contexts.\n- Grouping: Organize entries into logical sections and subsections.\n- Prioritizing: incorporate efficient algorithmic solutions, tricks, and strategies into the cheatsheet.\n- Diversity: Have as many useful and relevant memory items as possible to guide the model to tackle future questions.\n\nN.B. Keep in mind that once the cheatsheet is updated, any previous content not directly included will be lost and cannot be retrieved. Therefore, make sure to explicitly copy any (or all) relevant information from the previous cheatsheet to the new cheatsheet!!!\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Cheatsheet Template\nUse the following format for creating and updating the cheatsheet:\n\nNEW CHEATSHEET:\n```\n<cheatsheet>\n\nVersion: [Version Number]\n\nSOLUTIONS, AND IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS, AND PSEUDOCODES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n</cheatsheet>\n```\n\nN.B. Make sure that all information related to the cheatsheet is wrapped inside the <cheatsheet> block. The cheatsheet can be as long as circa 2000 words.\n\n-----\n-----\n\nYou are playing the game Twenty Questions. \n\nIn this game, there are 157 candidate words: Airplane, Apple, Banana, Baseball, Baseball bat, Basketball, Battery, Bear, Bed, Belt, Blender, Boat, Bookcase, Boots, Bowl, Bracelet, Broccoli, Brooch, Bus, Bush, Cactus, Calculator, Calendar, Camera, Cantaloupe, Canvas, Car, Carrot, Cat, Celery, Chair, Chopstick, Clarinet, Computer, Computer keyboard, Cooking pot, Corn, Couch, Cow, Cucumber, Cup, Desk, Diary, Dog, Doll, Dress, Dresser, Drill, Drum, Earring, Elephant, Eraser, Flute, Football, Forest, Fork, Gloves, Glue, Golf ball, Grape, Guitar, Hairclip, Hammer, Harp, Hat, Headphone, Helicopter, Helmet, Horse, Jacket, Key, Kite, Knife, Lake, Lawn mower, Lego, Lion, Locket, Mango, Marker, Mattress, Meteorite, Microwave, Monitor, Motorcycle, Mountain, Necklace, Nightstand, Ocean, Onion, Orange, Paintbrush, Painting, Pan, Pants, Paper, Peach, Peas, Pen, Pencil, Pendant, Piano, Pillow, Pineapple, Plate, Pliers, Potato, Printer, Puzzle, Rabbit, Rake, Refrigerator, Ring, River, Rock, Saw, Saxophone, Scarf, Scissors, Scooter, Screwdriver, Sculpture, Sea, Sharpie, Sheep, Ship, Shirt, Shoes, Shovel, Skirt, Smartphone, Soccer ball, Socks, Spinach, Spoon, Stapler, Strawberry, Table, Television, Tennis ball, Tennis racket, Tiger, Tomato, Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Train, Tree, Trombone, Truck, Trumpet, Violin, Volleyball, Watch, Watering can, Watermelon, Whisk, Wrench. \n\nOne of the 157 words is the answer word.

Start with the full list of candidate words.\n2. Ask a question that splits the list into two roughly equal groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n3. Based on the response, eliminate the irrelevant group.\n4. Repeat the process, narrowing down the pool with each question by targeting specific subcategories (e.g., \"Is the answer word related to transportation?\").\n5. Continue until the pool is small enough to identify the answer word directly.\n</example>\n** Count: 18\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nSpecific Trait Identification: Focus on unique or defining traits of the remaining candidates to pinpoint the answer word. (Reference: Game #1, Game #2, Game #3, Game #4, Game #5, Game #6, Game #7, Game #8, Game #9, Game #10, Game #11, Game #12, Game #13, Game #14, Game #15, Game #16, Game #17, Game #18)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Once the pool is small (e.g., 5-10 candidates), identify unique traits of each remaining candidate.\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is the answer word powered by an engine?\").\n3. Use the responses to eliminate all candidates except the one that matches the traits.\n</example>\n** Count: 18\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nHierarchical Questioning for Kitchenware: When the answer word is related to kitchenware, use a hierarchical approach to narrow down categories (e.g., type of item, specific usage, function). (Reference: Game #18)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Ask if the answer word is related to kitchenware.\n2. Narrow down by type (e.g., \"Is it a utensil?\" \u2192 \"Is it used for eating or serving food?\").\n3. For utensils, ask about the specific function (e.g., \"Is it used for cutting or slicing food?\" \u2192 \"Is it a knife?\").\n4.

Start with the full list of candidate words.\n2. Ask a question that splits the list into two roughly equal groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n3. Based on the response, eliminate the irrelevant group.\n4. Repeat the process, narrowing down the pool with each question by targeting specific subcategories (e.g., \"Is the answer word related to transportation?\").\n5. Continue until the pool is small enough to identify the answer word directly.\n</example>\n** Count: 19\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nSpecific Trait Identification: Focus on unique or defining traits of the remaining candidates to pinpoint the answer word.

Once the pool is small (e.g., 5-10 candidates), identify unique traits of each remaining candidate.\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is the answer word powered by an engine?\").\n3. Use the responses to eliminate all candidates except the one that matches the traits.\n</example>\n** Count: 19\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nHierarchical Questioning for Writing and Drawing Tools: When the answer word is related to writing or drawing tools, use a hierarchical approach to narrow down categories (e.g., type of tool, specific usage, material). (Reference: Game #19)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Ask if the answer word is related to writing or drawing tools.\n2. Narrow down by type (e.g., \"Is it used for writing?\" \u2192 \"Is it a pen or pencil?\").\n3. For writing tools, ask about specific traits (e.g., \"Is it a pen?\" \u2192 \"Is it a pencil?\").\n4.

Avoid wasting questions on ambiguous phrasing. (Reference: Game #14)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. If a question receives an invalid response, analyze the phrasing to identify potential ambiguity (e.g., \"Is the answer word red in color?\" may be unclear due to subjective interpretation).\n2. Reframe the question with more precise language (e.g., \"Is the answer word typically red in color when ripe?\").\n3.

Begin with a broad question that splits the candidate pool into two large groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n2. Follow up with questions that progressively narrow down the pool (e.g., \"Is the answer word a plant?\" \u2192 \"Is it a fruit?\" \u2192 \"Does it grow on a tree?\").\n3. Once the pool is small, switch to specific trait-based questions to identify the answer word directly.\n</example>\n** Count: 19\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nEfficiency Maximization: Aim to eliminate the largest possible group of candidates with each question. Avoid overly specific questions early in the game.

Analyze the candidate pool and identify the largest logical group.\n2. Formulate a question that targets this group (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\" eliminates all non-living things if the answer is No).\n3.

Once the pool is small (e.g., 5-10 candidates), identify unique traits of each remaining candidate.\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is the answer word powered by an engine?\").\n3. Use the responses to eliminate all candidates except the one that matches the traits.\n</example>\n** Count: 19\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nHierarchical Questioning for Writing and Drawing Tools: When the answer word is related to writing or drawing tools, use a hierarchical approach to narrow down categories (e.g., type of tool, specific usage, material). (Reference: Game #19)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Ask if the answer word is related to writing or drawing tools.\n2. Narrow down by type (e.g., \"Is it used for writing?\" \u2192 \"Is it a pen or pencil?\").\n3. For writing tools, ask about specific traits (e.g., \"Is it a pen?\" \u2192 \"Is it a pencil?\").\n4.

If a question receives an invalid response, analyze the phrasing to identify potential ambiguity (e.g., \"Is the answer word red in color?\" may be unclear due to subjective interpretation).\n2. Reframe the question with more precise language (e.g., \"Is the answer word typically red in color when ripe?\").\n3.

Purpose and Goals\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you are tasked with creating a continuously evolving reference designed to help solve a wide variety of tasks. The cheatsheet's purpose is to consolidate verified solutions, reusable strategies, and critical insights into a single, well-structured resource.\n\n- The cheatsheet should include quick, accurate, reliable, and practical solutions to a range of technical and creative challenges. \n- After seeing each case, you should improve the content of the cheatsheet, synthesizing lessons, insights, tricks, and errors learned from past problems and adapting to new challenges.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Core Responsibilities\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you should:\n   - Curate and preserve knolwedge: Select and document only the most relevant, most useful, and most actionable solutions and strategies, while preserving old content of the cheatsheet.\n   - Maintain accuracy: Ensure that all entries in the cheatsheet are accurate, clear, and well-contextualized. \n   - Refine and update content: Continuously update and improve the content of the cheatsheet by incorporating new insights and solutions, removing repetitions or trivial information, and adding efficient solutions.\n   - Ensure practicality and comprehensiveness: Provide critical and informative examples, as well as pseudocodes outlining steps to solve problems efficiently, and actionable guidelines. \n\nBefore updating the cheatsheet, however, you should first assess the correctness of the provided solution and strategically incorporate insights, solutions, and pseudocodes into the new cheatsheet. Always aim to preserve and keep correct, useful, and illustrative solutions and strategies for future cheatsheets.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Principles and Best Practices\n1. Accuracy and Relevance:\n   - Only include solutions and strategies that have been tested and proven effective.\n   - Clearly state any assumptions, limitations, or dependencies (e.g., specific solution hacks).\n\n2. Iterative Refinement:\n   - Continuously improve the cheatsheet by synthesizing both old and new solutions, refining explanations, and removing redundancies.\n   - Rather than deleting old content and writing new content each time, consider ways to maintain table content and synthesize information from multiple solutions.\n   - After solving a new problem, document any reusable strategies, edge cases, optimization techniques, or pseudocodes. \n\n3. Clarity and Usability:\n   - Write concise, actioanble, well-structured entries.\n   - Focus on key insights or strategies that make solutions correct and effective.\n\n4. Reusability:\n   - Provide clear solutions, meta strategies, and reasoning pseudocodes that are easily adaptable to different contexts.\n   - Avoid trivial content; focus on non-obvious, critical solution details and approaches.\n   - Make sure to add as many examples as you can in the cheatsheet. \n   - Any useful, efficient, generalizable, and illustrative solutions to the previous problems should be included in the cheatsheet.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Cheatsheet Structure\nThe cheatsheet can be divided into the following sections:\n\n1. Solutions, and Implementation Patterns:\n   - Document solution templates, and reusable reasoning pseudocodes.\n   - Include descriptions, annotated examples, and potential pitfalls, albeit succinctly.\n\n2. [OPTIONAL] Edge Cases and Validation Traps:\n   - Catalog scenarios that commonly cause errors or unexpected behavior.\n   - Provide checks, validations, or alternative approaches to handle them.\n\n3. General Meta-Reasoning Strategies:\n   - Describe high-level problem-solving frameworks and heuristics\n   - Provide concrete yet succinct step-by-step guides for tackling complex problems.\n\n4. Implement a Usage Counter\n   - Each entry must include a usage count: Increase the count every time a strategy is successfully used in problem-solving.\n   - Use the count to prioritize frequently used solutions over rarely applied ones.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Formatting Guidelines\nUse the following structure for each memory item:\n\n```\n<memory_item>\n<description>\n[Briefly describe the problem context, purpose, and key aspects of the solution.] (Refence: Q1, Q2, Q6, etc.)\n</description>\n<example>\n[Provide a worked-out solution, efficient strategy, or well-documented reasoning pseudocode.]\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count:  [Number of times this strategy has been used to solve a problem.]\n\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n[...]\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n```\n\n- Tagging: Use references like `(Q14)` or `(Q22)` to link entries to their originating contexts.\n- Grouping: Organize entries into logical sections and subsections.\n- Prioritizing: incorporate efficient algorithmic solutions, tricks, and strategies into the cheatsheet.\n- Diversity: Have as many useful and relevant memory items as possible to guide the model to tackle future questions.\n\nN.B. Keep in mind that once the cheatsheet is updated, any previous content not directly included will be lost and cannot be retrieved. Therefore, make sure to explicitly copy any (or all) relevant information from the previous cheatsheet to the new cheatsheet!!!\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Cheatsheet Template\nUse the following format for creating and updating the cheatsheet:\n\nNEW CHEATSHEET:\n```\n<cheatsheet>\n\nVersion: [Version Number]\n\nSOLUTIONS, AND IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS, AND PSEUDOCODES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n</cheatsheet>\n```\n\nN.B.

Start with the full list of candidate words.\n2. Ask a question that splits the list into two roughly equal groups (e.g., \"Is the answer word a living thing?\").\n3. Based on the response, eliminate the irrelevant group.\n4. Repeat the process, narrowing down the pool with each question by targeting specific subcategories (e.g., \"Is the answer word related to transportation?\").\n5. Continue until the pool is small enough to identify the answer word directly.\n</example>\n** Count: 20\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nSpecific Trait Identification: Focus on unique or defining traits of the remaining candidates to pinpoint the answer word.

Once the pool is small (e.g., 5-10 candidates), identify unique traits of each remaining candidate.\n2. Ask questions targeting these traits (e.g., \"Does the answer word have two wheels?\" or \"Is the answer word powered by an engine?\").\n3. Use the responses to eliminate all candidates except the one that matches the traits.\n</example>\n** Count: 20\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nHierarchical Questioning for Plants and Vegetables: When the answer word is related to plants or vegetables, use a hierarchical approach to narrow down categories (e.g., type of plant, specific traits, usage). (Reference: Game #20)\n</description>\n<example>\nStep-by-step pseudocode:\n1. Ask if the answer word is a plant.\n2. Narrow down by type (e.g., \"Is it a tree?\" \u2192 \"Is it a vegetable?\").\n3. For vegetables, ask about specific traits (e.g., \"Does it grow above ground?\" \u2192 \"Is it commonly green in color?\" \u2192 \"Is it commonly eaten raw?\").\n4.

Avoid assuming the answer word belongs to a specific subcategory too early (e.g., assuming \"spinach\" without confirming other possibilities like \"celery\").\n2. Ask broader questions to confirm the category (e.g., \"Is it a vegetable?\" \u2192 \"Does it grow above ground?\").\n3.
