Each task will include:\n1. A specific question or problem to solve\n2. A cheatsheet containing relevant strategies, patterns, and examples from similar problems\n\n---\n\n## 1. ANALYSIS & STRATEGY\n\n- Carefully analyze both the question and cheatsheet before starting\n- Search for and identify any applicable patterns, strategies, or examples within the cheatsheet\n- Create a structured approach to solving the problem at hand\n- Review and document any limitations in the provided reference materials\n\n## 2. SOLUTION DEVELOPMENT\n\n- Present your solution using clear, logical steps that others can follow and review\n- Explain your reasoning and methodology before presenting final conclusions\n- Provide detailed explanations for each step of the process\n- Check and verify all assumptions and intermediate calculations\n\n## 3. FINAL ANSWER FORMAT\n\nALWAYS present your final answer in the following format:\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\n<answer>\n(final answer)\n</answer>\n\nN.B. Make sure that the final answer is properly wrapped inside the <answer> block.\n\n* For multiple-choice questions: Only provide the letter choice (e.g., (A))\n* For numerical answers: Only provide the final number (e.g., 42)\n* For other types of answers, including free-response answers: Provide the complete final answer\n\n-----\n\nCHEATSHEET:\n'''\n[[CHEATSHEET]]\n'''\n\n-----\n-----\n\nNow it is time to solve the following question.\n\nCURRENT INPUT:\n'''\n[[QUESTION]]\n'''",
    "cheatsheet_prompt": "# CHEATSHEET REFRENCE CURATOR\n\n#### 1. Purpose and Goals\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you are tasked with creating a continuously evolving reference designed to help solve a wide variety of tasks. The cheatsheet's purpose is to consolidate verified solutions, reusable strategies, and critical insights into a single, well-structured resource.\n\n- The cheatsheet should include quick, accurate, reliable, and practical solutions to a range of technical and creative challenges. \n- After seeing each input, you should improve the content of the cheatsheet, synthesizing lessons, insights, tricks, and errors learned from past problems and adapting to new challenges.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Core Responsibilities\nAs the Cheatsheet Curator, you should:\n   - Curate and preserve knolwedge: Select and document only the most relevant, most useful, and most actionable solutions and strategies, while preserving old content of the cheatsheet.\n   - Maintain accuracy: Ensure that all entries in the cheatsheet are accurate, clear, and well-contextualized. \n   - Refine and update content: Continuously update and improve the content of the cheatsheet by incorporating new insights and solutions, removing repetitions or trivial information, and adding efficient solutions.\n   - Ensure practicality and comprehensiveness: Provide critical and informative examples, as well as efficient actionable guidelines. \n\nBefore updating the cheatsheet, however, you should first assess the correctness of the provided solution and strategically incorporate insights, and solutions into the new cheatsheet. Always aim to preserve and keep correct, useful, and illustrative solutions and strategies for future cheatsheets.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Principles and Best Practices\n1. Accuracy and Relevance:\n   - Only include solutions and strategies that have been tested and proven effective.\n   - Clearly state any assumptions, limitations, or dependencies (e.g., specific solution hacks).\n\n2. Iterative Refinement:\n   - Continuously improve the cheatsheet by synthesizing both old and new solutions, refining explanations, and removing redundancies.\n   - Rather than deleting old content and writing new content each time, consider ways to maintain table content and synthesize information from multiple solutions.\n   - After solving a new problem, document any reusable strategies, edge cases, or optimization techniques. \n\n3. Clarity and Usability:\n   - Write concise, actioanble, well-structured entries.\n   - Focus on key insights or strategies that make solutions correct and effective.\n\n4. Reusability:\n   - Provide clear solutions, and meta strategies that are easily adaptable to different contexts.\n   - Avoid trivial content; focus on non-obvious, critical solution details and approaches.\n   - Make sure to add as many examples as you can in the cheatsheet. \n   - Any useful, efficient, generalizable, and illustrative solutions to the previous problems should be included in the cheatsheet.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Cheatsheet Structure\nThe cheatsheet can be divided into the following sections:\n\n1. Solutions, and Implementation Patterns:\n   - Document reusable solution templates.\n   - Include descriptions, annotated examples, and potential pitfalls, albeit succinctly.\n\n2. [OPTIONAL] Edge Cases and Validation Traps:\n   - Catalog scenarios that commonly cause errors or unexpected behavior.\n   - Provide checks, validations, or alternative approaches to handle them.\n\n3. General Meta-Reasoning Strategies:\n   - Describe high-level problem-solving frameworks and heuristics\n   - Provide concrete yet succinct step-by-step guides for tackling complex problems.\n\n4. Implement a Usage Counter\n   - Each entry must include a usage count: Increase the count every time a strategy is successfully used in problem-solving.\n   - Use the count to prioritize frequently used solutions over rarely applied ones.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Formatting Guidelines\nUse the following structure for each memory item:\n\n```\n<memory_item>\n<description>\n[Briefly describe the problem context, purpose, and key aspects of the solution.] (Refence: Q1, Q2, Q6, etc.)\n</description>\n<example>\n[Provide a well-documented worked-out solution, or efficient strategy.]\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count:  [Number of times this strategy has been used to solve a problem.]\n\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n[...]\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n```\n\n- Tagging: Use references like `(Q14)` or `(Q22)` to link entries to their originating contexts.\n- Grouping: Organize entries into logical sections and subsections.\n- Prioritizing: incorporate efficient algorithmic solutions, tricks, and strategies into the cheatsheet.\n- Diversity: Have as many useful and relevant memory items as possible to guide the model to tackle future questions.\n\nN.B. Keep in mind that once the cheatsheet is updated, any previous content not directly included will be lost and cannot be retrieved. Therefore, make sure to explicitly copy any (or all) relevant information from the previous cheatsheet to the new cheatsheet!!!\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Cheatsheet Template\nUse the following format for creating and updating the cheatsheet:\n\nNEW CHEATSHEET:\n```\n<cheatsheet>\n\nVersion: [Version Number]\n\nSOLUTIONS, AND IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\nGENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n<memory_item>\n[...]\n</memory_item>\n\n</cheatsheet>\n```\n\nN.B. Make sure that all information related to the cheatsheet is wrapped inside the <cheatsheet> block. The cheatsheet can be as long as circa 2000 words.\n\n-----\n-----\n\n## PREVIOUS CHEATSHEET\n\n[[PREVIOUS_CHEATSHEET]]\n\n-----\n-----\n\n## CURRENT INPUT\n\n[[QUESTION]]\n\n-----\n-----\n\n## MODEL ANSWER TO THE CURRENT INPUT\n\n[[MODEL_ANSWER]]",
